## Design pattern

### 1. What are the main categories of Design Patterns? [⬆️](#top)

The three main categories of Design Patterns are:

1. **Creational Patterns**: Deal with object creation mechanisms

   - Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype
   - Focus on how objects are created and initialized

2. **Structural Patterns**: Deal with object composition and relationships

   - Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy
   - Focus on how objects are structured and composed

3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Deal with communication between objects and assignment of responsibilities
   - Observer, Strategy, Command, State, Template Method, Chain of Responsibility, Mediator, Memento, Visitor, Iterator, Interpreter
   - Focus on how objects interact and distribute responsibilities

---

### 2. What is Design Patterns and why anyone should use them? [⬆️](#top)

**Design Patterns** are reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. They represent best practices developed by experienced programmers over time.

**Why use Design Patterns:**

- **Reusability**: Proven solutions that can be applied to similar problems
- **Communication**: Provide a common vocabulary for developers
- **Best Practices**: Encapsulate years of experience and expertise
- **Maintainability**: Make code more organized and easier to maintain
- **Flexibility**: Create loosely coupled, extensible designs
- **Documentation**: Serve as templates for solving design problems
- **Quality**: Lead to more robust and reliable software

---

### 3. What is a pattern? [⬆️](#top)

A **pattern** is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into code, but rather a template or blueprint for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

**Key characteristics of a pattern:**

- **Name**: A descriptive and memorable name
- **Problem**: Description of when to apply the pattern
- **Solution**: Elements that make up the design, relationships, responsibilities
- **Consequences**: Results and trade-offs of applying the pattern

---

### 4. What is Singleton pattern? [⬆️](#top)

The **Singleton pattern** ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

**Implementation:**

```csharp
public class Singleton
{
    private static Singleton _instance;
    private static readonly object _lockObject = new object();

    private Singleton() { } // Private constructor

    public static Singleton Instance
    {
        get
        {
            if (_instance == null)
            {
                lock (_lockObject)
                {
                    if (_instance == null)
                        _instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
            return _instance;
        }
    }
}
```

**Use cases:**

- Database connections
- Configuration settings
- Logging services
- Caching

**Pros:** Controlled access, reduced memory footprint, global access
**Cons:** Can make testing difficult, potential concurrency issues, violates Single Responsibility Principle

---

### 5. What is Dependency Injection? [⬆️](#top)

**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern that implements Inversion of Control (IoC) for resolving dependencies. Instead of a class creating its dependencies internally, they are provided (injected) from external sources.

**Types of DI:**

1. **Constructor Injection**: Dependencies passed through constructor
2. **Property Injection**: Dependencies set through public properties
3. **Method Injection**: Dependencies passed as method parameters

**Example:**

```csharp
// Without DI
public class OrderService
{
    private EmailService emailService = new EmailService(); // Tight coupling
}

// With DI
public class OrderService
{
    private IEmailService emailService;

    public OrderService(IEmailService emailService) // Constructor injection
    {
        this.emailService = emailService;
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Loose coupling
- Easier testing (mock dependencies)
- Better maintainability
- Flexible configuration
- Separation of concerns

---

### 6. What is State pattern? [⬆️](#top)

The **State pattern** allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object appears to change its class.

**Key components:**

- **Context**: Maintains a reference to a state object
- **State**: Defines interface for state-specific behavior
- **ConcreteState**: Implements behavior associated with a state

**Example:**

```csharp
public interface IState
{
    void Handle(Context context);
}

public class Context
{
    private IState state;

    public void SetState(IState state)
    {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public void Request()
    {
        state.Handle(this);
    }
}

public class ConcreteStateA : IState
{
    public void Handle(Context context)
    {
        // State-specific behavior
        context.SetState(new ConcreteStateB());
    }
}
```

**Use cases:** State machines, game character states, UI controls, workflow systems

---

### 7. What is Null Object pattern? [⬆️](#top)

The **Null Object pattern** provides a default object with neutral behavior to represent the absence of an object, eliminating the need for null checks.

**Example:**

```csharp
public interface ILogger
{
    void Log(string message);
}

public class FileLogger : ILogger
{
    public void Log(string message)
    {
        // Write to file
    }
}

public class NullLogger : ILogger
{
    public void Log(string message)
    {
        // Do nothing - neutral behavior
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Eliminates null reference exceptions
- Simplifies code by removing null checks
- Provides default behavior
- More readable and maintainable code

---

### 8. What is Template pattern? [⬆️](#top)

The **Template Method pattern** defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, letting subclasses override specific steps without changing the algorithm's structure.

**Example:**

```csharp
public abstract class DataProcessor
{
    // Template method
    public void ProcessData()
    {
        ReadData();
        ProcessRawData();
        WriteData();
    }

    protected abstract void ReadData();
    protected abstract void ProcessRawData();
    protected abstract void WriteData();
}

public class CSVProcessor : DataProcessor
{
    protected override void ReadData() { /* Read CSV */ }
    protected override void ProcessRawData() { /* Process CSV data */ }
    protected override void WriteData() { /* Write processed data */ }
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Code reuse
- Consistent algorithm structure
- Easy to extend
- Follows Hollywood Principle ("Don't call us, we'll call you")

---

### 9. What is Iterator pattern? [⬆️](#top)

The **Iterator pattern** provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

**Example:**

```csharp
public interface IIterator<T>
{
    bool HasNext();
    T Next();
}

public class ListIterator<T> : IIterator<T>
{
    private List<T> list;
    private int position = 0;

    public ListIterator(List<T> list)
    {
        this.list = list;
    }

    public bool HasNext() => position < list.Count;

    public T Next() => list[position++];
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Uniform traversal interface
- Supports multiple simultaneous traversals
- Encapsulates iteration logic
- Simplifies collection interface

---

### 10. What is Strategy pattern? [⬆️](#top)

The **Strategy pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable at runtime.

**Example:**

```csharp
public interface IPaymentStrategy
{
    void Pay(decimal amount);
}

public class CreditCardPayment : IPaymentStrategy
{
    public void Pay(decimal amount) { /* Credit card logic */ }
}

public class PayPalPayment : IPaymentStrategy
{
    public void Pay(decimal amount) { /* PayPal logic */ }
}

public class PaymentContext
{
    private IPaymentStrategy strategy;

    public void SetStrategy(IPaymentStrategy strategy)
    {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void ExecutePayment(decimal amount)
    {
        strategy.Pay(amount);
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Runtime algorithm selection
- Easy to add new strategies
- Eliminates conditional statements
- Follows Open/Closed Principle

---

### 11. What is Proxy pattern? [⬆️](#top)

The **Proxy pattern** provides a placeholder or surrogate for another object to control access to it.

**Types of Proxies:**

1. **Virtual Proxy**: Controls access to expensive-to-create objects
2. **Protection Proxy**: Controls access based on permissions
3. **Remote Proxy**: Represents objects in different address spaces
4. **Smart Proxy**: Adds additional behavior when accessing objects

**Example:**

```csharp
public interface IImage
{
    void Display();
}

public class RealImage : IImage
{
    private string filename;

    public RealImage(string filename)
    {
        this.filename = filename;
        LoadFromDisk();
    }

    private void LoadFromDisk()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Loading {filename}");
    }

    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Displaying {filename}");
    }
}

public class ProxyImage : IImage
{
    private RealImage realImage;
    private string filename;

    public ProxyImage(string filename)
    {
        this.filename = filename;
    }

    public void Display()
    {
        if (realImage == null)
        {
            realImage = new RealImage(filename); // Lazy loading
        }
        realImage.Display();
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Controls access to objects
- Lazy initialization
- Caching and performance optimization
- Security and access control

---

### 12. What are some benefits of Repository Pattern? [⬆️](#top)

The **Repository pattern** encapsulates data access logic and provides a uniform interface for accessing domain objects.

**Benefits:**

1. **Testability**: Easy to mock for unit testing
2. **Centralized Query Logic**: All queries for an entity type in one place
3. **Flexibility**: Can switch data sources without affecting business logic
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Isolates data access from business logic
5. **Consistency**: Provides consistent interface across different entities
6. **Caching**: Can implement caching at repository level
7. **Transaction Management**: Easier to manage transactions

**Example:**

```csharp
public interface IUserRepository
{
    User GetById(int id);
    IEnumerable<User> GetAll();
    void Add(User user);
    void Update(User user);
    void Delete(int id);
}

public class UserRepository : IUserRepository
{
    private readonly DbContext context;

    public UserRepository(DbContext context)
    {
        this.context = context;
    }

    public User GetById(int id) => context.Users.Find(id);
    // ... other implementations
}
```

---

### 13. What is Filter pattern? [⬆️](#top)

The **Filter pattern** (also known as Criteria pattern) allows filtering objects based on different criteria and chaining them in a decoupled manner.

**Example:**

```csharp
public interface IFilter<T>
{
    IEnumerable<T> Filter(IEnumerable<T> items);
}

public class AndFilter<T> : IFilter<T>
{
    private IFilter<T> filter1;
    private IFilter<T> filter2;

    public AndFilter(IFilter<T> filter1, IFilter<T> filter2)
    {
        this.filter1 = filter1;
        this.filter2 = filter2;
    }

    public IEnumerable<T> Filter(IEnumerable<T> items)
    {
        return filter2.Filter(filter1.Filter(items));
    }
}

public class AgeFilter : IFilter<Person>
{
    private int minAge;

    public AgeFilter(int minAge)
    {
        this.minAge = minAge;
    }

    public IEnumerable<Person> Filter(IEnumerable<Person> people)
    {
        return people.Where(p => p.Age >= minAge);
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Flexible filtering logic
- Easy to combine filters
- Reusable filter components
- Clean separation of filter logic

---

### 14. What is Builder pattern? [⬆️](#top)

The **Builder pattern** constructs complex objects step by step, allowing you to produce different types and representations using the same construction process.

**Example:**

```csharp
public class Computer
{
    public string CPU { get; set; }
    public string RAM { get; set; }
    public string Storage { get; set; }
    public string GPU { get; set; }
}

public class ComputerBuilder
{
    private Computer computer = new Computer();

    public ComputerBuilder SetCPU(string cpu)
    {
        computer.CPU = cpu;
        return this;
    }

    public ComputerBuilder SetRAM(string ram)
    {
        computer.RAM = ram;
        return this;
    }

    public ComputerBuilder SetStorage(string storage)
    {
        computer.Storage = storage;
        return this;
    }

    public ComputerBuilder SetGPU(string gpu)
    {
        computer.GPU = gpu;
        return this;
    }

    public Computer Build() => computer;
}

// Usage
var computer = new ComputerBuilder()
    .SetCPU("Intel i7")
    .SetRAM("16GB")
    .SetStorage("1TB SSD")
    .Build();
```

**Benefits:**

- Control over construction process
- Fluent interface
- Immutable objects
- Flexible object creation

### 15. Name types of Design Patterns? [⬆️](#top)

Design patterns are categorized into three main types:

**1. Creational Patterns (5 patterns):**

- **Singleton**: Ensures only one instance exists
- **Factory Method**: Creates objects without specifying exact classes
- **Abstract Factory**: Creates families of related objects
- **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step
- **Prototype**: Creates objects by cloning existing instances

**2. Structural Patterns (7 patterns):**

- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together
- **Bridge**: Separates abstraction from implementation
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures
- **Decorator**: Adds behavior to objects dynamically
- **Facade**: Provides simplified interface to complex subsystem
- **Flyweight**: Minimizes memory usage by sharing common data
- **Proxy**: Controls access to another object

**3. Behavioral Patterns (11 patterns):**

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes requests along handler chain
- **Command**: Encapsulates requests as objects
- **Iterator**: Provides sequential access to elements
- **Mediator**: Defines how objects interact
- **Memento**: Captures and restores object state
- **Observer**: Notifies multiple objects about state changes
- **State**: Changes object behavior based on internal state
- **Strategy**: Encapsulates algorithms and makes them interchangeable
- **Template Method**: Defines algorithm skeleton in base class
- **Visitor**: Separates algorithms from object structure
- **Interpreter**: Defines grammar representation and interpreter

> **Note:** This document contains detailed answers for key design patterns. The remaining questions in this section follow the same comprehensive format. For the complete set of answers to all 139 design pattern questions, each would include detailed explanations, code examples, use cases, benefits, and trade-offs.

### 16. What is Inversion of Control? [⬆️](#top)

**Inversion of Control (IoC)** is a design principle where the control of object creation and dependency management is transferred from the object itself to an external container or framework.

**Key Concepts:**

- Objects don't create their dependencies directly
- Dependencies are provided by external mechanism
- Reduces coupling between classes
- Makes code more testable and maintainable

**Implementation Methods:**

1. **Dependency Injection**: Constructor, Property, or Method injection
2. **Service Locator**: Central registry for services
3. **Factory Pattern**: Factory creates and manages dependencies
4. **Template Method**: Framework calls application code

**Benefits:**

- Loose coupling
- Better testability
- Easier maintenance
- Flexible configuration
- Separation of concerns

---

### 17. Why would you want to use a Repository Pattern with an ORM? [⬆️](#top)

While ORMs provide data access capabilities, the Repository pattern adds additional benefits:

**Reasons to use Repository with ORM:**

1. **Abstraction Layer**: Hides ORM-specific details from business logic
2. **Testability**: Easy to mock repository for unit testing
3. **Centralized Queries**: Business-specific queries in one place
4. **Query Reusability**: Common queries can be reused across application
5. **Caching**: Implement caching at repository level
6. **Validation**: Business rule validation before data persistence
7. **Domain-Specific Methods**: Methods that make sense for business domain
8. **Future Flexibility**: Easier to switch ORMs or data sources

**Example:**

```csharp
public interface IUserRepository
{
    Task<User> GetActiveUserByEmailAsync(string email);
    Task<IEnumerable<User>> GetUsersWithExpiredSubscriptionsAsync();
    Task<bool> IsEmailUniqueAsync(string email);
}

public class UserRepository : IUserRepository
{
    private readonly DbContext context;

    public async Task<User> GetActiveUserByEmailAsync(string email)
    {
        return await context.Users
            .Where(u => u.Email == email && u.IsActive)
            .FirstOrDefaultAsync();
    }
}
```

### 18. What are the drawbacks to the ActiveRecord pattern? [⬆️](#top)

The **ActiveRecord pattern** combines the data access logic with the domain/business logic inside a single class. While it’s simple and widely used in frameworks like Ruby on Rails or Laravel, it comes with notable drawbacks:

---

**Drawbacks:**

1. **Violation of Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**

   - ActiveRecord classes handle both persistence and business logic.
   - This makes them harder to maintain and less modular.

2. **Tight Coupling with Database Schema:**

   - Domain model is directly tied to database structure.
   - Changes in schema can easily break business logic.

3. **Difficult Unit Testing:**

   - Business logic relies on database access.
   - Testing requires a real or mocked database, slowing down test cycles.

4. **Poor Separation of Concerns:**

   - Domain logic is mixed with persistence logic.
   - Harder to isolate domain rules from data storage concerns.

5. **Limited Scalability for Complex Domains:**

   - Works fine for CRUD operations, but struggles with rich domain models and complex business logic.
   - Domain-Driven Design (DDD) often favors patterns like Repository and Data Mapper instead.

6. **Reduced Flexibility with Multiple Data Sources:**
   - Tightly bound to one database model.
   - Harder to switch to another persistence strategy (e.g., NoSQL, external API).

---

**Example in C#:**

```csharp
public class User // ActiveRecord style
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    public bool IsActive { get; set; }

    // Persistence logic
    public void Save(DbContext context)
    {
        if (Id == 0)
            context.Users.Add(this);
        else
            context.Users.Update(this);

        context.SaveChanges();
    }

    // Business logic
    public bool CanAccessFeature()
    {
        return IsActive && Email.EndsWith("@company.com");
    }
}
```

---

### 19. What is the Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) Pattern? [⬆️](#top)

**CQRS** separates **commands** (write operations that change state) from **queries** (read operations that return data). Instead of using one model for both, CQRS uses distinct models optimized for their purpose.

---

**Key Concepts:**

- **Commands:** Change system state (e.g., `CreateOrder`).
- **Queries:** Retrieve data without changing state (e.g., `GetOrdersByCustomer`).
- **Separate Models:** Write model for business rules, read model for fast queries.
- **Optional Event Sourcing:** Store events instead of current state.

---

**Benefits:**

- Clear separation of concerns
- Independent scalability of reads and writes
- Performance via read-optimized stores
- Flexibility with different storage technologies

**Drawbacks:**

- More complexity
- Eventual consistency if separate data stores are used
- Overkill for simple CRUD apps

---

**Example (C#):**

```csharp
// Command
public class CreateOrderCommand {
    public int CustomerId;
    public List<int> ProductIds;
}

// Query
public class GetOrdersByCustomerQuery {
    public int CustomerId;
}
```

### 20. What are some advantages of using Dependency Injection [⬆️](#top)

**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a technique where an object’s dependencies are provided externally rather than the object creating them itself. This promotes loose coupling and flexibility in applications.

---

**Advantages:**

1. **Loose Coupling:**

   - Classes depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
   - Easier to swap implementations without changing client code.

2. **Improved Testability:**

   - Dependencies can be mocked or stubbed during unit testing.
   - No need for actual database, API, or service in tests.

3. **Better Maintainability:**

   - Centralized configuration of dependencies.
   - Changes in one service don’t ripple across the system.

4. **Flexibility & Reusability:**

   - Easy to provide different implementations (e.g., local vs cloud storage).
   - Increases reusability of components.

5. **Scalability:**

   - Large applications become easier to manage as dependencies are injected by a container or framework.

6. **Adherence to SOLID Principles:**
   - Especially **Dependency Inversion Principle** (high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules).

**Example in C#:**

```csharp
// Service Interface
public interface IMessageService
{
    void Send(string message);
}

// Implementation
public class EmailService : IMessageService
{
    public void Send(string message) => Console.WriteLine($"Email: {message}");
}

// Client using DI via constructor
public class Notification
{
    private readonly IMessageService _messageService;

    public Notification(IMessageService messageService)
    {
        _messageService = messageService;
    }

    public void Notify(string msg) => _messageService.Send(msg);
}
```

### 21. What are some reasons to use Repository Pattern? [⬆️](#top)

The **Repository Pattern** provides an abstraction over data access, making the persistence layer independent from the business logic layer.

---

**Reasons to Use Repository Pattern:**

1. **Separation of Concerns:**

   - Keeps data access logic separate from business logic.
   - Improves code readability and organization.

2. **Abstraction Over Data Source:**

   - Hides database/ORM-specific details.
   - Business layer works with repositories instead of raw queries.

3. **Improved Testability:**

   - Repositories can be mocked or stubbed for unit testing.
   - No need for real database in tests.

4. **Reusability of Queries:**

   - Common queries are centralized in repositories.
   - Prevents duplication of data access logic.

5. **Consistency:**

   - Provides a consistent API for data operations.
   - Easier for developers to work with.

6. **Flexibility for Future Changes:**

   - Switching databases or ORMs requires minimal changes in repository layer.
   - Business code remains unaffected.

7. **Centralized Validation & Caching:**
   - Add business rule validation or caching logic at repository level.

---

**Example in C#:**

```csharp
public interface IProductRepository
{
    Task<Product> GetByIdAsync(int id);
    Task<IEnumerable<Product>> GetAllAsync();
    Task AddAsync(Product product);
}

public class ProductRepository : IProductRepository
{
    private readonly DbContext _context;

    public async Task<Product> GetByIdAsync(int id) =>
        await _context.Products.FindAsync(id);

    public async Task<IEnumerable<Product>> GetAllAsync() =>
        await _context.Products.ToListAsync();

    public async Task AddAsync(Product product)
    {
        _context.Products.Add(product);
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
    }
}
```

## OOP

### 1. What is Inheritance? [⬆️](#top)

**Inheritance** is an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concept where one class (child/derived) acquires the properties and behaviors (fields and methods) of another class (parent/base).  
It promotes **code reuse**, **hierarchical relationships**, and **polymorphism**.

---

#### 🔑 Key Points

- Child class inherits methods/fields from parent class
- Supports **code reuse** and **extensibility**
- Enables **method overriding** (runtime polymorphism)
- Supports an **"is-a"** relationship (Dog _is a_ Animal)

---

#### 💻 Example (Java)

```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    void eat() { cout << "Eating...\n"; }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void bark() { cout << "Barking...\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Dog d;
    d.eat();
    d.bark();
}

```

#### Short Answer

-“Inheritance allows a class to reuse the fields and methods of another class, enabling code reuse and supporting polymorphism.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- Inheritance = acquiring properties/behaviors of another class
- Promotes code reuse
- Enables hierarchical classification
- Supports polymorphism (method overriding)
- Represents an is-a relationship

---

### 2. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)? [⬆️](#top)

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which combine **data** (fields/properties) and **behavior** (methods/functions).  
It helps in building modular, reusable, and maintainable software.

---

#### 🔑 Key Features (4 Pillars)

1. **Encapsulation** → Wrapping data and behavior into a single unit (class)
2. **Abstraction** → Hiding implementation details and exposing only essentials
3. **Inheritance** → Reusing code by acquiring properties/behaviors from another class
4. **Polymorphism** → One interface, many implementations (compile-time & runtime)

---

#### 💻 Example (Java)

```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void sound() { cout << "Animal makes a sound\n"; }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void sound() override { cout << "Dog barks\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Animal* a = new Dog();
    a->sound(); // Polymorphism: calls Dog's sound()
    delete a;
}
```

---

#### Short Interview Answer

“OOP is a paradigm that organizes software into objects combining data and behavior, built around encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- OOP = objects with state (data) + behavior (methods)
- Promotes modularity, reusability, maintainability
- Based on four pillars: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism
- Improves real-world modeling in software

---

### 3. Why is the `virtual` keyword used in code? [⬆️](#top)

The **`virtual` keyword** (in languages like C# and C++) is used to indicate that a method or property can be **overridden** in a derived (child) class.  
It enables **runtime polymorphism**, allowing the program to decide at runtime which method implementation to call.

---

#### 🔑 Key Points

- Declares a method as **overridable**
- Supports **method overriding** in inheritance
- Enables **dynamic dispatch** (runtime binding)
- Without `virtual`, methods are **statically bound** (compile-time binding)

---

#### 💻 Example (C#)

```csharp
class Animal {
    public virtual void Speak() {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog : Animal {
    public override void Speak() {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Program {
    static void Main() {
        Animal a = new Dog();
        a.Speak(); // Output: Dog barks (runtime polymorphism)
    }
}
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“The virtual keyword allows a method to be overridden in a child class, enabling runtime polymorphism and flexible behavior.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- Marks methods as overridable in derived classes
- Enables runtime polymorphism (dynamic method dispatch)
- Improves extensibility and flexibility
- Used in inheritance-based hierarchies

---

### 4. What is the difference between Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming? [⬆️](#top)

**Procedural Programming (POP)** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** are two programming paradigms that differ in how they structure code.

#### 🔑 Key Differences

| Aspect            | Procedural Programming (POP)            | Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)        |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Focus**         | Functions and procedures                | Objects (data + behavior)                |
| **Data Handling** | Data is separate from functions         | Data and behavior are bundled in classes |
| **Approach**      | Top-down approach                       | Bottom-up approach                       |
| **Reusability**   | Achieved via functions                  | Achieved via classes & inheritance       |
| **Security**      | Data less secure (global access common) | Data encapsulated (access modifiers)     |
| **Polymorphism**  | Not supported                           | Supported (compile-time & runtime)       |
| **Examples**      | C, Pascal                               | Java, C#, Python, C++                    |

#### 💻 Example

**Procedural (C):**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
void greet() { printf("Hello, World!"); }
int main() { greet(); }

```

#### Short Interview Answer

“Procedural programming focuses on functions and procedures, while OOP focuses on objects that bundle data and behavior. OOP supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it more modular, reusable, and secure.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- POP = functions/procedures; OOP = objects/classes
- OOP supports encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
- OOP is more modular, reusable, and secure
- POP is simpler for small tasks, OOP better for large, complex systems

---

### 5. What is a Class? [⬆️](#top)

A **class** is a **blueprint or template** in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that defines the structure and behavior of objects.  
It encapsulates **data** (fields/properties) and **methods** (functions) into a single unit.

---

#### 🔑 Key Points

- A class does not occupy memory until an **object** is created.
- Defines the **attributes (state)** and **behaviors (methods)** of objects.
- Promotes **encapsulation** and **code reusability**.
- Objects are **instances of a class**.

---

#### 💻 Example (C#)

```csharp
class Car {
    public string Brand;
    public void Drive() {
        Console.WriteLine(Brand + " is driving...");
    }
}

class Program {
    static void Main() {
        Car c = new Car();
        c.Brand = "Tesla";
        c.Drive(); // Output: Tesla is driving...
    }
}
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“A class is a blueprint for creating objects, combining fields for data and methods for behavior. Objects are instances of a class.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- Class = blueprint/template for objects
- Combines data + behavior into one unit
- Supports encapsulation and reusability
- Objects are created as instances of a class

---

### 6. Explain the basic features of OOPs [⬆️](#top)

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** provides a set of features that help in building modular, reusable, and maintainable software.

#### 🔑 Basic Features of OOP

1. **Class** → Blueprint or template for creating objects.
2. **Object** → Instance of a class representing real-world entities.
3. **Encapsulation** → Bundling data and related methods into a single unit (class).
4. **Abstraction** → Hiding implementation details, exposing only essential features.
5. **Inheritance** → Reusing and extending functionality of an existing class.
6. **Polymorphism** → One interface, many implementations (method overloading & overriding).
7. **Message Passing** → Objects communicate with each other by invoking methods.
8. **Dynamic Binding** → Method implementation is determined at runtime.

#### 🎯 Short Interview Answer

“OOPs is built around features like classes, objects, encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, which together make code modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.”

#### ✅ Points to Mention in Interview

- **Class & Object** → Foundation of OOP
- **Encapsulation & Abstraction** → Data protection & simplicity
- **Inheritance** → Code reuse and extension
- **Polymorphism** → Flexibility in behavior
- **Dynamic Binding & Message Passing** → Runtime flexibility & object communication

---

### 7. Can you inherit private members of a class? [⬆️](#top)

**No, private members are not directly inherited** by child classes.  
They are part of the object’s memory but can only be accessed **indirectly** through public/protected methods of the parent.

#### 💻 Example (C++)

```cpp
class Base {
private:
    int x = 10; // not directly accessible
protected:
    int getX() { return x; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    int reveal() { return getX(); } // indirect access
};
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“Private members are not accessible in child classes. They exist in memory but can only be accessed indirectly via the parent’s public/protected methods.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- Not directly inherited
- Still part of derived object’s memory
- Access only via public/protected methods
- Ensures encapsulation

---

### 8. What is the difference between a Class and a Structure? [⬆️](#top)

A **class** and a **structure** are both user-defined types, but they differ in how they store data, handle access, and support OOP features.

#### 🔑 Key Differences

| Aspect                | Class                              | Structure                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Default Access**    | Members are **private** by default | Members are **public** by default          |
| **Inheritance**       | Supports inheritance (OOP feature) | Usually does **not** (in C++ only partial) |
| **Polymorphism**      | Supports (via virtual functions)   | Not typically supported                    |
| **Encapsulation**     | Fully supports                     | Limited support                            |
| **Memory Allocation** | Allocated on heap or stack         | Typically allocated on stack               |
| **Use Case**          | Complex entities with behavior     | Lightweight data-holding entities          |
| **Keyword**           | `class`                            | `struct`                                   |

#### 💻 Example (C++)

```cpp
class MyClass {
    int a; // private by default
};

struct MyStruct {
    int b; // public by default
};
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“A class is generally used for complex entities and supports full OOP features like inheritance and polymorphism, while a structure is mostly for lightweight data storage with members public by default.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- Default access → Class = private, Struct = public
- OOP support → Class = full, Struct = limited
- Usage → Class = complex behavior, Struct = simple data
- Memory → Class (heap/stack), Struct (stack, lightweight)

---

### 9. What is the relationship between a class and an object? [⬆️](#top)

A **class** is a blueprint or template, while an **object** is an instance created from that blueprint.  
Objects bring classes to life by occupying memory and holding actual data.

#### 🔑 Key Points

- **Class** → Defines structure and behavior (data + methods).
- **Object** → Instance of a class that stores real values.
- A class can create **multiple objects**, each with independent state.
- **Class = definition**, **Object = realization**.

#### 💻 Example (C++)

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    void drive() { /* behavior */ }
};

int main() {
    Car c1;          // object created from class
    c1.brand = "BMW";
}
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“A class is a blueprint that defines properties and behaviors, while an object is an instance of that class with actual data in memory.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- Class = template/blueprint
- Object = instance of a class
- Multiple objects can be created from one class
- Objects hold state and perform behavior

---

### 10. What is an Object? [⬆️](#top)

An **object** is an **instance of a class** in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
It represents a real-world entity with **state** (data/attributes) and **behavior** (methods/functions).

#### 🔑 Key Points

- Created from a **class blueprint**.
- Occupies **memory** when instantiated.
- Holds **state (fields/variables)** and exposes **behavior (methods)**.
- Multiple objects of the same class can exist, each with its own state.

#### 💻 Example (C++)

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    void drive() { /* behavior */ }
};

int main() {
    Car c1;          // object
    c1.brand = "Tesla";
}
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“An object is an instance of a class that combines state and behavior. It represents real-world entities and is created from a class blueprint.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- Object = instance of a class
- Contains state (data) + behavior (methods)
- Created using a class, stored in memory
- Multiple objects can be created from one class

---

### 11. Explain the concept of Constructor [⬆️](#top)

A **constructor** is a **special method** in a class that is automatically called when an object is created.  
It is used to **initialize the object’s state** (set default values or perform setup).

#### 🔑 Key Points

- Name is the **same as the class**.
- **No return type** (not even `void`).
- Called **automatically** when an object is created.
- Can be **overloaded** (multiple constructors with different parameters).
- If not defined, a **default constructor** is provided by the compiler.

#### 💻 Example (C++)

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    // Constructor
    Car(string b) { brand = b; }
};

int main() {
    Car c1("Tesla"); // constructor called
}
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“A constructor is a special method that initializes an object when it is created. It has the same name as the class and no return type.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- Constructor = special method for initialization
- Same name as class, no return type
- Invoked automatically on object creation
- Supports overloading
- Compiler provides a default constructor if none is defined

---

### 12. What is Encapsulation? [⬆️](#top)

**Encapsulation** is an OOP concept of **bundling data (fields) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class)** and restricting direct access to the data.  
It ensures that the internal representation of an object is hidden and can only be accessed in a **controlled way**.

#### 🔑 Key Points

- Achieved using **access modifiers** (`private`, `protected`, `public`).
- Provides **data hiding** by restricting direct access.
- Exposes controlled access via **getters and setters**.
- Increases **security, flexibility, and maintainability**.

#### 💻 Example (C++)

```cpp
class Account {
private:
    int balance; // hidden data
public:
    void setBalance(int b) { balance = b; }
    int getBalance() { return balance; }
};
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data and methods into a class and restricting direct access to the data using access modifiers, ensuring controlled and secure access.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- Encapsulation = wrapping data + methods into a class
- Achieved via access modifiers
- Provides data hiding & controlled access
- Improves security, flexibility, and maintainability

---

### 13. What is Polymorphism? [⬆️](#top)

**Polymorphism** means **“many forms”**.  
In OOP, it allows the same method or operator to behave differently based on the object or context.  
It improves **flexibility** and supports **extensibility**.

#### 🔑 Types of Polymorphism

1. **Compile-time (Static) Polymorphism**

   - Achieved by **method overloading** or **operator overloading**.
   - Decided at **compile time**.

2. **Runtime (Dynamic) Polymorphism**
   - Achieved by **method overriding** using `virtual`/`override`.
   - Decided at **runtime** via dynamic dispatch.

#### 💻 Example (C++)

```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void sound() { cout << "Animal sound\n"; }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void sound() override { cout << "Dog barks\n"; }
};
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“Polymorphism allows the same method or operation to take multiple forms. It can be achieved through overloading (compile-time) or overriding (runtime).”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- Polymorphism = many forms
- Compile-time → Method/Operator Overloading
- Runtime → Method Overriding
- Enables flexibility & code reuse
- Core OOP pillar along with inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation

---

### 14. How could you define Abstraction in OOP? [⬆️](#top)

**Abstraction** is the process of **hiding implementation details** and exposing only the **essential features** of an object.  
It allows programmers to focus on **what an object does** rather than **how it does it**.

#### 🔑 Key Points

- Achieved using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.
- Reduces **complexity** by hiding unnecessary details.
- Increases **modularity and maintainability**.
- Supports **loose coupling** in design.

#### 💻 Example (C++)

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override { cout << "Drawing Circle\n"; }
};
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“Abstraction is the OOP principle of hiding implementation details and showing only essential functionality, typically achieved using abstract classes or interfaces.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- Abstraction = hide implementation, show functionality
- Achieved via abstract classes & interfaces
- Improves modularity, maintainability, and loose coupling
- Focuses on what not how

---

### 15. How can you prevent your class to be inherited further? [⬆️](#top)

To prevent a class from being inherited (i.e., making it a **sealed class**), languages provide specific keywords.

#### 💻 Example (C++)

```cpp
class Base final {   // 'final' prevents inheritance
public:
    void display() { cout << "Base class"; }
};
// class Derived : public Base { }; // Error: Base is final
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“We can prevent inheritance by declaring the class as sealed in C# or final in C++. This ensures no other class can derive from it.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- C++ → use final keyword
- C# → use sealed keyword
- Used when class design should not be extended
- Improves security, control, and design stability

---

### 16. What do you mean by Data Encapsulation? [⬆️](#top)

**Data Encapsulation** is the concept of **bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class)**, while restricting direct access to the internal state of an object.  
It is implemented using **access modifiers** (like `private`, `protected`, `public`) to control visibility.

#### 🔑 Key Points

- Keeps internal object state **hidden** from the outside world.
- Provides controlled access through **getters and setters**.
- Improves **security, maintainability, and flexibility**.
- Protects data integrity by **preventing unauthorized modification**.

#### 💻 Example (C++)

```cpp
class Account {
private:
    double balance; // hidden data

public:
    void deposit(double amount) { balance += amount; }
    double getBalance() { return balance; }
};
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“Encapsulation means wrapping data and methods into a class and restricting direct access to the internal state using access modifiers, ensuring controlled and secure data handling.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- Encapsulation = data hiding + bundling data with methods
- Achieved using access modifiers (private, public, protected)
- Provides security, maintainability, and data integrity
- Access only through methods (getters/setters)

---

### 17. What's the difference between a method and a function in OOP context? [⬆️](#top)

In OOP, both **functions** and **methods** are blocks of code that perform specific tasks, but they differ in how they are associated with classes and objects.

#### 🔑 Key Differences

| Aspect      | Function                                           | Method                                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Belongs to  | Independent, not tied to a class                   | Defined inside a class                |
| Access      | Called directly                                    | Called on an object or class instance |
| Data access | Cannot directly access object state (needs params) | Can access and modify object state    |
| Binding     | Not associated with `this`                         | Associated with the `this` reference  |

#### 💻 Example (C++)

```cpp
// Function
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

// Method inside class
class Calculator {
public:
    int multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;  // method tied to class
    }
};
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“A function is a standalone block of code, while a method is a function defined inside a class that operates on its objects. Methods can access and modify the internal state of the object, but functions cannot.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- Function = independent
- Method = function inside a class
- Methods use object’s state via this
- Functions work only with passed parameters

---

### 18. Can you specify the accessibility modifier for methods inside the interface? [⬆️](#top)

In most OOP languages, **methods inside an interface are implicitly public**, and you **cannot specify other access modifiers** (like `private` or `protected`) for them.  
This is because an interface defines a **contract** that must be fully accessible to implementing classes.

#### 🔑 Key Points

- **C#** → All interface methods are **public** by default; no other modifier is allowed.
- **Java** → Interface methods are **public and abstract** by default.
- Purpose: Ensure all implementing classes provide accessible definitions.
- Data members in interfaces are usually **public, static, and final**.

#### 💻 Example (C#)

```csharp
interface IShape {
    void Draw();  // Implicitly public
}

// class must implement as public
class Circle : IShape {
    public void Draw() {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing Circle");
    }
}
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“No, you cannot specify access modifiers for interface methods. They are implicitly public to enforce a common contract for all implementing classes.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- Interface methods = implicitly public
- No private or protected allowed
- Ensures contract is accessible to all implementers

---

### 19. Is it possible for a class to inherit the constructor of its base class? [⬆️](#top)

By default, **constructors are not inherited** by derived classes because they are meant to initialize the base class only.  
However, many OOP languages provide ways to **reuse or call base class constructors**.

#### 🔑 Key Points

- **C++** → A derived class does not inherit constructors, but it can call them using the `base` (initializer list) or explicitly inherit using `using`.
- **C#** → Constructors are not inherited, but the derived class can invoke the base constructor using the `: base()` keyword.
- Purpose: Ensure proper initialization of base class state.

#### 💻 Example (C++)

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    Base(int x) { cout << "Base constructor: " << x << endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived(int y) : Base(y) { }  // explicitly calls Base constructor
};
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“Constructors are not inherited directly, but a derived class can invoke the base class constructor using initializer lists in C++ or the base keyword in C#.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- Constructors not inherited by default
- Can be called explicitly in derived class
- C++ → using or initializer list
- C# → : base() keyword

---

### 20. What are similarities between a class and a structure? [⬆️](#top)

Both **classes** and **structures** are user-defined data types in OOP that allow bundling of data and functions together.

#### 🔑 Key Similarities

- Both can contain **fields (data members)** and **methods (functions)**.
- Both support **encapsulation** by using access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`).
- Both can define **constructors** and **member functions**.
- Both allow **operator overloading** (in C++).
- Both can create **instances (objects)**.
- Both can work with **polymorphism** and **inheritance features** (language-specific, e.g., limited in C#).

#### 💻 Example (C++)

```cpp
struct Student {
    int id;
    void display() { cout << "Student ID: " << id << endl; }
};

class Teacher {
    int id;
public:
    Teacher(int tid) : id(tid) {}
    void display() { cout << "Teacher ID: " << id << endl; }
};
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“Classes and structures are similar because both can have data members, methods, constructors, and access modifiers, and they allow object creation and encapsulation.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- Both are user-defined types
- Both support fields + methods
- Both can have constructors
- Both support encapsulation & access modifiers
- Both allow object creation

---

### 21. What are the different ways a method can be Overloaded? [⬆️](#top)

**Method Overloading** means defining multiple methods with the **same name** but with **different parameter lists** in the same class.  
It provides **compile-time polymorphism**.

#### 🔑 Ways to Overload a Method

1. **Different number of parameters**
   ```cpp
   void print(int x);
   void print(int x, int y);
   ```
2. **Different types of parameters**
   ```cpp
   void show(int x);
   void show(double y);
   ```
3. **Different order of parameters (when types differ)**
   ```cpp
   void display(int x, string y);
   void display(string y, int x);
   ```

#### Short Interview Answer

“A method can be overloaded by changing the number, type, or order of parameters. The return type alone cannot be used for overloading.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- Overloading = same method name, different signatures
- Achieved by number, type, or order of parameters
- Return type change alone is not valid
- Provides compile-time polymorphism

---

### 22. Interface or an Abstract class: which one to use? [⬆️](#top)

Both **interfaces** and **abstract classes** are used to achieve **abstraction** in OOP, but they serve different purposes.  
Choosing between them depends on the design requirements.

#### 🔑 When to Use an **Interface**

- When you need to define a **contract** that multiple classes can implement.
- When there is **no shared implementation**, only method signatures.
- To support **multiple inheritance** (since a class can implement multiple interfaces).

#### 🔑 When to Use an **Abstract Class**

- When classes share **common code/behavior** (partial implementation).
- When you want to provide **default implementations** along with abstract methods.
- When you need to define **common fields or properties**.

#### 💻 Example (C#)

```csharp
interface IDrawable {
    void Draw();  // contract only
}

abstract class Shape {
    public abstract void Area();  // must be implemented
    public void Info() => Console.WriteLine("I am a Shape."); // default impl
}
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“Use an interface when you only need a contract with no implementation.
Use an abstract class when you want to provide partial implementation or shared behavior. Interfaces support multiple inheritance, while abstract classes do not.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- Interface → contract only, multiple inheritance allowed.
- Abstract class → partial implementation + common state/behavior.
- Choose based on whether you need only signatures or shared logic.

---

### 23. What is Unit Of Work? [⬆️](#top)

The **Unit of Work (UoW) pattern** is a design pattern that **maintains a list of operations (insert, update, delete)** on objects during a business transaction and ensures that all these operations are either **committed together** or **rolled back together**.

It acts like a **transaction manager** for handling changes in a consistent way.

#### 🔑 Key Points

- Tracks changes to objects in a transaction.
- Coordinates the writing of changes as a **single unit**.
- Ensures **atomicity** → either all operations succeed or none do.
- Reduces **round trips** to the database.

#### 💻 Example (C# Pseudo)

```csharp
using (var unitOfWork = new UnitOfWork()) {
    var repo = unitOfWork.GetRepository<Customer>();
    repo.Add(new Customer { Name = "Arpit" });

    unitOfWork.Commit(); // saves all changes at once
}
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“Unit of Work is a design pattern that keeps track of changes during a transaction and commits them as a single operation, ensuring consistency and reducing database calls.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- Maintains list of operations in a transaction
- Ensures commit/rollback as one unit
- Improves consistency and performance
- Works closely with Repository pattern

---

### 24. What is the difference between Interface and Abstract Class? [⬆️](#top)

Both **interfaces** and **abstract classes** are used to achieve **abstraction** in OOP, but they differ in purpose and usage.

#### 🔑 Key Differences

| Feature          | Interface                                       | Abstract Class                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Implementation   | Cannot provide implementation (only signatures) | Can provide partial implementation         |
| Fields/State     | Cannot have instance fields                     | Can have fields, properties, and constants |
| Access Modifiers | All methods are implicitly `public`             | Can use `public`, `protected`, `private`   |
| Constructors     | Not allowed                                     | Allowed                                    |
| Inheritance      | Supports multiple inheritance                   | Only single inheritance                    |
| Use Case         | Define a **contract**                           | Provide **shared code + contract**         |

#### 💻 Example (C#)

```csharp
interface IDrawable {
    void Draw();  // only declaration
}

abstract class Shape {
    public abstract void Area();   // must implement in derived class
    public void Info() => Console.WriteLine("I am a Shape"); // shared logic
}
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“An interface defines only a contract (no implementation), while an abstract class can provide both abstract methods and shared implementation. Interfaces support multiple inheritance, whereas abstract classes allow only single inheritance.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- Interface → contract only
- Abstract class → contract + shared behavior
- Interface → multiple inheritance possible
- Abstract class → can have fields, constructors, access modifiers

---

### 25. How can you prevent a class from overriding in C#? [⬆️](#top)

In C#, you can prevent overriding in two ways:

1. **Prevent a class from being inherited** → use the `sealed` keyword on the class.
2. **Prevent a method from being overridden further** → mark it as `sealed` in the derived class.

#### 💻 Example 1: Prevent Class Inheritance

```csharp
sealed class Base {
    public void Show() => Console.WriteLine("Base class method");
}

// class Derived : Base { } // ❌ Error: cannot inherit from sealed class
```

#### Example 2: Prevent Method Overriding

```csharp
class Base {
    public virtual void Display() => Console.WriteLine("Base Display");
}
class Derived : Base {
    public sealed override void Display() => Console.WriteLine("Derived Display");
}
class SubDerived : Derived {
    // public override void Display() { } // ❌ Error: sealed method
}
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“In C#, use the sealed keyword to prevent inheritance of a class or to stop further overriding of a method.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- sealed class → cannot be inherited.
- sealed override → method cannot be overridden further.
- Ensures design stability and security.

---

### 26. What is the difference between Virtual method and Abstract method? [⬆️](#top)

Both **virtual** and **abstract** methods support **polymorphism**, but they differ in how they are implemented and used.

#### 🔑 Key Differences

| Feature        | Virtual Method                                 | Abstract Method                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Implementation | Has a default implementation                   | No implementation, must be overridden      |
| Declaration    | Declared with `virtual` keyword                | Declared with `abstract` keyword           |
| Overriding     | Optional to override in derived class          | Mandatory to override in derived class     |
| Class Type     | Can exist in normal or abstract classes        | Can only exist in an abstract class        |
| Purpose        | Provide a **default behavior** that may change | Enforce a **contract** for derived classes |

#### 💻 Example (C#)

```csharp
abstract class Shape {
    public virtual void Info() {
        Console.WriteLine("I am a Shape"); // default implementation
    }
    public abstract void Draw(); // no implementation
}

class Circle : Shape {
    public override void Draw() {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing Circle"); // must implement
    }
    public override void Info() {
        Console.WriteLine("I am a Circle"); // optional override
    }
}
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“A virtual method provides a default implementation that can be optionally overridden, while an abstract method has no implementation and must be overridden in derived classes.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- Virtual → default behavior, optional override
- Abstract → no implementation, mandatory override
- Abstract methods exist only in abstract classes
- Virtual methods work in both abstract and normal classes

---

### 27. When should I use a struct instead of a class? [⬆️](#top)

In OOP, **structs** are value types, while **classes** are reference types.  
You should use a **struct** when you want a lightweight object with value semantics.

#### 🔑 When to Use a Struct

- When the object is **small and simple** (e.g., coordinates, points, colors).
- When the object represents a **single value or record**.
- When you want **value-type behavior** (copied by value, not by reference).
- When the object is **immutable** (state doesn’t change after creation).
- When you don’t need **inheritance** (structs don’t support it in most OOP languages).

#### 💻 Example (C#)

```csharp
struct Point {
    public int X, Y;
    public Point(int x, int y) {
        X = x; Y = y;
    }
}
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“Use a struct when you need a small, lightweight, and immutable data type that represents a value, not an entity. If you need inheritance or complex behavior, use a class.”

#### Points to Mention in Interview

- Struct = value type, Class = reference type
- Struct → small, simple, immutable data
- Struct → no inheritance, better performance for small objects
- Class → complex objects with behavior, inheritance, and reference semantics

---

### 28. What is Polymorphism, what is it for, and how is it used? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Definition

Polymorphism means **"many forms"**.  
In OOP, it allows the same method, operator, or object to take different forms depending on the context.

---

#### 🎯 Purpose

- To enable **flexibility and reusability** in code.
- To let **one interface handle different underlying data types**.
- To make code **easier to maintain and extend**.

---

#### 🔑 Types of Polymorphism

1. **Compile-time (Static Polymorphism)**

   - Achieved via **method overloading** or **operator overloading**.
   - Decided by the compiler.

2. **Run-time (Dynamic Polymorphism)**
   - Achieved via **method overriding** using `virtual` / `override` (C#) or `virtual` / `override` (C++).
   - Decided at runtime using **dynamic dispatch**.

---

#### 💻 Example – Runtime Polymorphism (C#)

```csharp
class Animal {
    public virtual void Speak() {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal speaks");
    }
}
class Dog : Animal {
    public override void Speak() {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks");
    }
}
class Cat : Animal {
    public override void Speak() {
        Console.WriteLine("Cat meows");
    }
}
// Usage
Animal a1 = new Dog();
Animal a2 = new Cat();
a1.Speak(); // Dog barks
a2.Speak(); // Cat meows
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“Polymorphism allows the same method or object to behave differently based on context. It can be compile-time (overloading) or run-time (overriding). It’s mainly used for flexibility, code reusability, and achieving abstraction in OOP.”

---

### 29. What are abstract classes? What are the distinct characteristics of an abstract class? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Definition

An **abstract class** is a class that **cannot be instantiated** directly and is meant to be a **base class**.  
It may contain **abstract methods (without implementation)** that must be implemented by derived classes, along with normal (concrete) methods.

#### 🔑 Characteristics of Abstract Classes

- Declared using the `abstract` keyword.
- **Cannot be instantiated** directly.
- Can have both **abstract methods** (no body) and **concrete methods** (with body).
- Can define **fields, constructors, and access modifiers**.
- Supports **inheritance** → derived classes must implement all abstract methods.
- Provides a **common base** with partial implementation for derived classes.

#### 💻 Example – Abstract Class (C#)

```csharp
abstract class Shape {
    public abstract void Draw(); // Abstract method
    public void Info() {         // Concrete method
        Console.WriteLine("This is a shape.");
    }
}

class Circle : Shape {
    public override void Draw() {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a Circle");
    }
}

// Usage
Shape s = new Circle();
s.Draw(); // Drawing a Circle
s.Info(); // This is a shape.
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“An abstract class is a base class that cannot be instantiated and may contain both abstract and concrete methods. It enforces a contract for derived classes while allowing partial implementation, making it useful when classes share common behavior but also require specific implementations.”

---

### 30. State the features of an Interface [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Definition

An **interface** is a contract in OOP that defines a set of **methods, properties, or events** that a class must implement.  
It provides **abstraction** and supports **multiple inheritance of type**.

#### 🔑 Features of an Interface

- Declared using the `interface` keyword.
- **Cannot be instantiated** directly.
- By default, all members are **public** and **abstract** (no implementation).
- A class or struct that implements an interface must **implement all its members**.
- Supports **multiple inheritance** (a class can implement multiple interfaces).
- Cannot contain **fields or constructors** (C# 8+ allows default method implementations).
- Used to define **capabilities/behavior** (e.g., `IDisposable`, `IComparable`).

#### 💻 Example – Interface (C#)

```csharp
interface IAnimal {
    void Speak();
}

class Dog : IAnimal {
    public void Speak() {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks");
    }
}

// Usage
IAnimal animal = new Dog();
animal.Speak(); // Dog barks
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“An interface is a contract that defines only the signatures of members without implementation. It provides abstraction, allows multiple inheritance, and ensures that classes implement specific behavior.”

### 31. How is method overriding different from method overloading? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔑 Key Differences

| Aspect              | Method Overloading                                                         | Method Overriding                                                           |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**      | Same method name with different signatures (parameters) in the same class. | Redefining a base class method in a derived class using the same signature. |
| **Purpose**         | To achieve _compile-time polymorphism_.                                    | To achieve _runtime polymorphism_.                                          |
| **Parameters**      | Must be different (number or type).                                        | Must be the same as in the base class.                                      |
| **Return Type**     | Can be different if method signatures differ.                              | Must be the same (or covariant).                                            |
| **Access Modifier** | Can vary.                                                                  | Cannot reduce the visibility of the base method.                            |
| **Keywords** (C#)   | No special keyword needed.                                                 | Uses `virtual` in base and `override` in derived class.                     |

#### 💻 Example in C#

```csharp
// Overloading
class MathOps {
    public int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;
    public double Add(double a, double b) => a + b;
}

// Overriding
class Animal {
    public virtual void Speak() {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal speaks");
    }
}

class Dog : Animal {
    public override void Speak() {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“Method overloading means having multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists in the same class (compile-time polymorphism).
Method overriding means redefining a base class method in a derived class with the same signature, using virtual and override in C# (runtime polymorphism).”

### 32. What is a static constructor? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Definition

A **static constructor** is a special constructor in C# used to initialize **static members** of a class.  
It is executed **only once**, automatically, before the first instance is created or any static member is accessed.

#### 🔑 Key Points

- Declared using the `static` keyword.
- Cannot have parameters or access modifiers.
- Runs automatically, no explicit call required.
- Used mainly for initializing **static fields** or performing **one-time setup**.

#### 💻 Example in C#

```csharp
class Logger {
    public static string FilePath;

    // Static constructor
    static Logger() {
        FilePath = "log.txt";
        Console.WriteLine("Static constructor executed");
    }
}

class Program {
    static void Main() {
        Console.WriteLine(Logger.FilePath); // Triggers static constructor
    }
}
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“A static constructor initializes static members of a class. It has no parameters, runs automatically only once, and is used for one-time setup like loading configuration or initializing static data.”

### 33. What exactly is the difference between an Interface and Abstract Class? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔑 Key Differences

| Aspect               | Interface                                                                            | Abstract Class                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**       | A contract that defines only signatures (methods, properties, events).               | A class that can have both abstract (unimplemented) and concrete (implemented) members. |
| **Implementation**   | Cannot contain fields or constructors (C# 8+ allows default method implementations). | Can contain fields, constructors, and fully implemented methods.                        |
| **Inheritance**      | Supports multiple inheritance (a class can implement many interfaces).               | Supports single inheritance only.                                                       |
| **Access Modifiers** | Members are always public (by default).                                              | Members can have access modifiers (public, protected, etc.).                            |
| **Use Case**         | Defines capabilities or contracts (e.g., `IDisposable`, `IComparable`).              | Defines a base class with common functionality and enforces specific implementations.   |

---

#### 💻 Example in C#

```csharp
interface IAnimal {
    void Speak(); // Only signature
}

abstract class Animal {
    public abstract void Speak(); // Must be implemented
    public void Eat() {           // Concrete method
        Console.WriteLine("Animal eats");
    }
}

class Dog : Animal, IAnimal {
    public override void Speak() {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“An interface is a contract with only method/property signatures and supports multiple inheritance, while an abstract class can have both abstract and concrete members but only supports single inheritance. Use interfaces for capabilities, and abstract classes when sharing base functionality.”

### 34. Differentiate between an abstract class and an interface [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔑 Key Differences

| Aspect               | Abstract Class                                                                                                        | Interface                                                                                                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**       | A class that cannot be instantiated and may contain both abstract (unimplemented) and concrete (implemented) members. | A contract that defines only method/property signatures (no state or implementation, except C# 8+ default methods). |
| **Members**          | Can have fields, constructors, properties, methods (abstract and non-abstract).                                       | Cannot have fields or constructors (but can have properties, methods, events).                                      |
| **Access Modifiers** | Members can have different access modifiers (public, protected, etc.).                                                | All members are public by default.                                                                                  |
| **Inheritance**      | A class can inherit only one abstract class (single inheritance).                                                     | A class can implement multiple interfaces (multiple inheritance).                                                   |
| **Use Case**         | Used when classes share common base functionality and require extension.                                              | Used to define capabilities/behavior across unrelated classes.                                                      |

---

#### 💻 Example in C#

```csharp

    void Speak();  // Only signature
}

class Dog : Animal, IAnimal {
    public override void Speak() {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“An abstract class provides partial implementation and shared functionality with single inheritance, while an interface only defines contracts with multiple inheritance support. Use abstract classes for base functionality, and interfaces for common capabilities.”

---

### 35. Does .NET support Multiple Inheritance? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Answer

- **.NET does not support multiple inheritance of classes** (a class cannot inherit from more than one base class).
- However, **.NET supports multiple inheritance through interfaces** (a class can implement multiple interfaces).

#### 🔑 Key Points

- Avoids ambiguity issues like the _Diamond Problem_.
- Promotes clean design by using **interfaces for behavior** and **abstract/base classes for shared functionality**.
- Common in frameworks: e.g., a class can implement both `IDisposable` and `IComparable`.

#### 💻 Example in C#

```csharp
interface IReadable {
    void Read();
}

interface IWritable {
    void Write();
}

class FileHandler : IReadable, IWritable {
    public void Read() => Console.WriteLine("Reading file...");
    public void Write() => Console.WriteLine("Writing file...");
}
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“.NET does not support multiple inheritance of classes but supports multiple inheritance through interfaces. This avoids ambiguity while still allowing a class to implement multiple capabilities.”

---

### 36. What is Coupling in OOP? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Definition

**Coupling** refers to the degree of dependency between two classes, modules, or components in an object-oriented system.  
It describes **how tightly or loosely connected** different parts of the system are.

#### 🔑 Types of Coupling

- **Tight Coupling**:

  - Classes are highly dependent on each other.
  - Changes in one class often force changes in another.
  - Example: Direct object creation using `new`.

- **Loose Coupling**:
  - Classes depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations.
  - Makes code more flexible, testable, and maintainable.
  - Achieved using Dependency Injection, Interfaces, or Design Patterns (e.g., Strategy, Observer).

#### 💻 Example in C#

```csharp
// Tight Coupling
class Engine { }
class Car {
    private Engine engine = new Engine(); // Direct dependency
}

// Loose Coupling
interface IEngine { void Start(); }
class PetrolEngine : IEngine { public void Start() => Console.WriteLine("Petrol engine starts"); }
class Car {
    private readonly IEngine engine;
    public Car(IEngine engine) { this.engine = engine; }
}
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“Coupling in OOP refers to the dependency level between classes. Tight coupling makes code rigid and harder to maintain, while loose coupling (using interfaces or dependency injection) makes it flexible, testable, and easier to extend.”

### 37. What is the difference between an abstract function and a virtual function? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔑 Key Differences

| Aspect                   | Abstract Function                                                                                       | Virtual Function                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**           | A function declared without implementation in an abstract class; must be overridden in derived classes. | A function with a base implementation that can be overridden in derived classes. |
| **Implementation**       | Has **no body** in the base class.                                                                      | Has a **body (default implementation)** in the base class.                       |
| **Keyword (C#)**         | Declared with `abstract`.                                                                               | Declared with `virtual`.                                                         |
| **Override Requirement** | Must be overridden in derived classes.                                                                  | Can be optionally overridden in derived classes.                                 |
| **Use Case**             | Enforces derived classes to implement specific behavior.                                                | Provides a default implementation but allows customization.                      |

#### 💻 Example in C#

```csharp
abstract class Animal {
    public abstract void Speak(); // Abstract: no implementation
    public virtual void Eat() {   // Virtual: default implementation
        Console.WriteLine("Animal eats");
    }
}

class Dog : Animal {
    public override void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Dog barks");
    public override void Eat() => Console.WriteLine("Dog eats bones");
}
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“An abstract function has no implementation and must be overridden in derived classes, while a virtual function provides a default implementation that derived classes may override if needed.”

---

### 38. What is Cohesion in OOP? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Definition

**Cohesion** refers to how closely related and focused the responsibilities of a single class or module are.  
It measures the **degree to which elements inside a class work together** to perform a single task.

#### 🔑 Types of Cohesion

- **High Cohesion** ✅

  - A class is focused on a single responsibility.
  - Easier to maintain, test, and reuse.
  - Example: A `Logger` class only handles logging.

- **Low Cohesion** ❌
  - A class does multiple unrelated tasks.
  - Harder to understand and maintain.
  - Example: A `Utility` class doing file I/O, database access, and logging.

#### 💻 Example in C#

```csharp
// High Cohesion
class InvoicePrinter {
    public void PrintInvoice() {
        Console.WriteLine("Printing Invoice...");
    }
}

// Low Cohesion
class Utility {
    public void PrintInvoice() { }
    public void ConnectDatabase() { }
    public void SendEmail() { }
}
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“Cohesion in OOP describes how focused a class is on a single responsibility. High cohesion means a class does one thing well (maintainable and reusable), while low cohesion means it mixes unrelated tasks (harder to maintain).”

---

### 39. Can you declare an overridden method to be static if the original method is not static? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Answer

- **No**, in C# you cannot declare an overridden method as `static` if the original method is not `static`.
- Overriding requires the method to have the **same signature and modifiers** (except `override`).
- `static` methods belong to the class, not to an instance, so they cannot participate in runtime polymorphism.

#### 💻 Example in C#

```csharp
class BaseClass {
    public virtual void Show() {
        Console.WriteLine("Base Show");
    }
}

class DerivedClass : BaseClass {
    // Invalid: cannot change to static
    // public static override void Show() { }

    // Correct override
    public override void Show() {
        Console.WriteLine("Derived Show");
    }
}
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“No, you cannot make an overridden method static if the original method is not static. Overriding requires matching instance methods, while static methods belong to the class and do not support polymorphism.”

---

### 40. Could you explain some benefits of Repository Pattern? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Definition

The **Repository Pattern** acts as a **mediator between the domain and the data access layer**, providing a clean abstraction for data retrieval and persistence.

#### 🔑 Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**
  - Keeps business logic independent from data access logic.
- **Testability**
  - Makes it easier to unit test business logic by mocking repositories.
- **Maintainability**
  - Centralizes data access code, making it easier to update or fix.
- **Abstraction**
  - Hides database-specific queries and exposes a clean API to the application.
- **Flexibility**
  - Enables swapping data sources (e.g., SQL, NoSQL, in-memory) with minimal changes.
- **Consistency**
  - Promotes a uniform way of accessing data across the system.

#### 💻 Example in C#

```csharp
public interface ICustomerRepository {
    Customer GetById(int id);
    void Add(Customer customer);
}

public class CustomerRepository : ICustomerRepository {
    public Customer GetById(int id) {
        // DB logic hidden here
        return new Customer { Id = id, Name = "John" };
    }

    public void Add(Customer customer) {
        // Save to DB
    }
}
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“The Repository Pattern abstracts the data access layer, improving separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability. It allows business logic to work with a clean API while hiding database details.”

---

### 41. Explain the concept of Destructor [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Definition

A **Destructor** is a special method in object-oriented programming that is automatically invoked when an object is about to be destroyed.  
Its primary purpose is to **release resources** such as memory, file handles, or database connections.

#### 🔑 Characteristics

- Has the **same name as the class** prefixed with `~` in C#.
- **No parameters** and **no return type**.
- **Automatically called** by the Garbage Collector (in managed languages like C#).
- A class can have **only one destructor**.
- Cannot be **overloaded or inherited**.
- Typically used for **cleanup tasks**.

#### 💻 Example in C#

```csharp
class Demo {
    public Demo() {
        Console.WriteLine("Constructor called");
    }

    ~Demo() {
        Console.WriteLine("Destructor called - Cleaning up resources");
    }
}
```

#### Short Interview Answer

“A Destructor is a special method that gets called automatically when an object is destroyed. It is used to release unmanaged resources like file handles, database connections, or memory.”

---

### 42. Explain different types of Inheritance [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Definition

**Inheritance** is an OOP concept that allows a class (child/derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent/base class).  
It promotes **code reusability** and **polymorphism**.

#### 🔑 Types of Inheritance

1. **Single Inheritance**

   - A class inherits from one base class.
   - Simplest and most common type.

   ```csharp
   class Animal {
       public void Eat() => Console.WriteLine("Eating...");
   }

   class Dog : Animal {
       public void Bark() => Console.WriteLine("Barking...");
   }
   ```

2. **Multilevel Inheritance**

   - A class is derived from a child class, forming a chain of inheritance.

   ```csharp
   class Animal {
    public void Eat() => Console.WriteLine("Eating...");
   }

    class Mammal : Animal {
    public void Walk() => Console.WriteLine("Walking...");
    }

    class Dog : Mammal {
    public void Bark() => Console.WriteLine("Barking...");
    }

    ```

3. **Hierarchical Inheritance**

    - Multiple classes inherit from the same base class.

    ```csharp
    class Animal {
        public void Eat() => Console.WriteLine("Eating...");
    }
    class Dog : Animal {
        public void Bark() => Console.WriteLine("Barking...");
    }
    class Cat : Animal {
        public void Meow() => Console.WriteLine("Meowing...");
    }
    ```

4. **Multiple Inheritance**

    - A class inherits from more than one base class.
    - In C#, this is achieved using Interfaces.

    ```csharp
    interface IWalker {
        void Walk();
    }

    interface IRunner {
        void Run();
    }

    class Person : IWalker, IRunner {
        public void Walk() => Console.WriteLine("Walking...");
        public void Run() => Console.WriteLine("Running...");
    }
    ```

5. **Hybrid Inheritence**

    - A combination of two or more types of inheritance.
    - Supported in C# only through interfaces, not directly with classes (to avoid ambiguity).

#### Short Interview Answer
- “In OOP, inheritance can be of different types:
- Single (one base → one derived),
- Multilevel (chain of classes),
- Hierarchical (one base → many derived),
- Multiple (a class inherits multiple parents, supported via interfaces in C#), and
- Hybrid (combination).
- C# supports single, multilevel, hierarchical, and multiple inheritance through interfaces.”

### 43. What's the advantage of using getters and setters - that only get and set - instead of simply using public fields for those variables? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Answer
Getters and setters provide **encapsulation, flexibility, and maintainability**, while public fields expose internal implementation.

#### 🔑 Key Points
- **Encapsulation** → Keep fields private, control access.  
- **Future-Proofing** → Add validation, logging, or computed logic later without breaking code.  
- **Access Control** → Support read-only/write-only properties.  
- **Attributes & Reflection** → Properties can be decorated with metadata.  

#### Public Fields
- No validation, no control, breaks encapsulation.

#### Interview Summary
“Getters/setters ensure encapsulation and future flexibility, unlike public fields which directly expose data.”

---

### 44. How to solve Circular Reference? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Definition
A **circular reference** occurs when two or more entities reference each other directly or indirectly, creating an infinite loop in dependency.


#### 🔑 Ways to Solve
- **Refactor design** → Break dependency with an intermediate class/service.  
- **Dependency Injection (DI)** → Invert control to remove direct dependencies.  
- **Use Interfaces** → Depend on abstractions, not concrete classes.  
- **Lazy Loading / Callbacks** → Delay dependency until needed.  
- **Serialization** → Ignore circular references (e.g., `[JsonIgnore]` in C#).


#### 💻 Example in C# (Breaking Circular Dependency with DI)

```csharp
interface IServiceA { void DoWork(); }
interface IServiceB { void DoWork(); }

class ServiceA : IServiceA {
    private readonly IServiceB _serviceB;
    public ServiceA(IServiceB serviceB) { _serviceB = serviceB; }
    public void DoWork() => Console.WriteLine("A working with B");
}

class ServiceB : IServiceB {
    public void DoWork() => Console.WriteLine("B working independently");
}

// Using Dependency Injection
var serviceB = new ServiceB();
var serviceA = new ServiceA(serviceB);

serviceA.DoWork();
```

#### Interview Summary

“Circular references are solved by breaking tight coupling — usually with dependency injection, interfaces, or refactoring design.”

--- 

### 45. When should I use an Interface and when should I use a Base Class? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔑 Interfaces
- Use when you need to define **contracts** without implementation.  
- Best for **multiple inheritance** scenarios.  
- Ideal for **loosely coupled systems**.  
- Example: `IDisposable`, `IEnumerable`.

#### 🔑 Base Classes
- Use when you want to provide **shared implementation** to derived classes.  
- Suitable when classes share **common state or behavior**.  
- Supports **polymorphism** via `virtual`/`abstract` methods.  
- Example: `Stream`, `Controller`.


#### 💻 Example in C#

```csharp
interface ILogger {
    void Log(string message); // Contract only
}

abstract class BaseRepository {
    public void Save() => Console.WriteLine("Save to DB"); // Shared implementation
    public abstract void Validate(); // Must be implemented by derived class
}
```

#### Interview Summary
- Use Interface → when you need a contract with no shared code.
- Use Base Class → when you need shared behavior and polymorphism.

---

### 46. What is the difference between Cohesion and Coupling? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔑 Cohesion
- Defines how closely the responsibilities of a single module/class are related.  
- **High Cohesion** → Each class/module has a focused purpose.  
- Leads to better readability, reusability, and maintainability.  

#### 🔑 Coupling
- Defines how dependent one module/class is on another.  
- **Low Coupling** → Modules interact through clear interfaces, not internal details.  
- Leads to flexible, testable, and loosely connected systems.  


#### 📊 Comparison Table

| Aspect        | Cohesion (Within a module)       | Coupling (Between modules)         |
|---------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Focus         | Internal responsibilities        | External dependencies              |
| Desired Level | **High Cohesion**                | **Low Coupling**                   |
| Benefits      | Easier to maintain, focused code | Flexible, easier to change/test    |


#### 💻 Example in C#

```csharp
// High Cohesion: Class focused on one responsibility
class InvoicePrinter {
    public void PrintInvoice() => Console.WriteLine("Printing Invoice...");
}

// Low Coupling: Uses abstraction (interface) to interact
interface IPaymentService {
    void ProcessPayment();
}

class Order {
    private readonly IPaymentService _paymentService;
    public Order(IPaymentService paymentService) {
        _paymentService = paymentService;
    }
    public void Checkout() => _paymentService.ProcessPayment();
}
```

#### Interview Summary
- Aim for High Cohesion → each class does one thing well.
- Aim for Low Coupling → classes depend on abstractions, not implementations.

---

### 47. What is the difference between Association, Aggregation and Composition? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔑 Association
- A general relationship between two classes.  
- Represents "uses" or "knows" relationship.  
- Can be **one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many**.  

#### 🔑 Aggregation
- A special form of Association (weak "has-a").  
- Child can exist independently of the parent.  
- Example: `Department` ↔ `Employee` (Employee exists even if Department is deleted).  

#### 🔑 Composition
- Strong form of Association (strong "owns-a").  
- Child **cannot exist** without the parent.  
- Example: `House` → `Room` (Room cannot exist without House).  


#### 📊 Comparison Table

| Concept      | Definition                         | Dependency | Example                  |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------|
| Association  | General relationship                | Loose      | Teacher ↔ Student        |
| Aggregation  | Weak "has-a" relationship           | Child free | Department ↔ Employee    |
| Composition  | Strong "owns-a" relationship        | Child tied | House → Room             |


#### 💻 Example in C#

```csharp
// Association
class Teacher {
    public void Teach(Student s) => Console.WriteLine("Teaching...");
}
class Student { }

// Aggregation
class Department {
    public List<Employee> Employees { get; set; } = new();
}
class Employee { }

// Composition
class House {
    private Room room; // Strong ownership
    public House() { room = new Room(); }
}
class Room { }
```

#### Interview Summary
- Association → General link between classes.
- Aggregation → Weak "has-a", child independent.
- Composition → Strong "owns-a", child depends on parent.

### 48. Why doesn't C# allow static methods to implement an interface? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔑 Explanation
- Interfaces are meant to define **contracts for instances** of classes.  
- Static methods belong to the **type itself**, not an instance.  
- Since interfaces define behavior that implementing classes must provide at the **object level**, static methods cannot satisfy this contract.  


#### 📌 Key Points
- Static methods are not polymorphic (they can't be overridden).  
- Interfaces rely on polymorphism to allow multiple classes to be treated uniformly.  
- Allowing static methods in interfaces would break the **contract-based design** principle.  


#### 💻 Example in C#

```csharp
interface ILogger {
    void Log(string message); // instance-level contract
}

class FileLogger : ILogger {
    public void Log(string message) => Console.WriteLine($"Log: {message}");
}

// This works because Log is tied to an object instance. If Log were static, polymorphism and contracts wouldn’t work.

```

#### Interview Summary
- Interfaces define instance-level contracts, not type-level.
- Static methods can’t be overridden → hence not compatible with interfaces.

---

### 49. Can you provide a simple explanation of methods vs. functions in OOP context? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Definition

- **Function**  
  - A standalone block of code that performs a task.  
  - Can exist independently, not tied to any object or class.  

- **Method**  
  - A function that is **associated with a class or object**.  
  - Can access or modify the object's internal state (fields/properties).  


#### 💻 Example in C#

```csharp
// Function (static, independent)
static int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;

// Method (instance-level, part of a class)
class Calculator {
    public int Multiply(int a, int b) => a * b;
}

Calculator calc = new Calculator();
int result = calc.Multiply(2, 3);
```

#### Interview Summary

“A function is independent, while a method belongs to a class or object and can access its state. Methods are essentially object-oriented functions.”

---


### 50. Can you declare a private class in a namespace? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Answer
- **No**, C# does not allow a class to be `private` directly within a namespace.  
- Classes declared in a namespace can only be **public** or **internal**.  


#### 🔑 Explanation
- **Private modifier** is valid only for **nested classes** inside another class.  
- Top-level classes must be accessible within the assembly (`internal`) or publicly (`public`).  


#### 💻 Example in C#

```csharp
// ✅ Allowed
internal class MyClass { }

// ❌ Not allowed
// private class MyClass { }

// Private nested class
public class OuterClass {
    private class InnerClass { } // ✅ Allowed
}
```

#### Interview Summary

“In C#, a top-level class in a namespace cannot be private. Use internal for assembly-level access or public for global access. Private classes are allowed only as nested classes.”

---

### 51. Could you elaborate Polymorphism vs Overriding vs Overloading? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Polymorphism
- **Definition:** Ability of an object to take many forms.  
- **Types:**  
  - **Compile-time (Static)** → Method overloading  
  - **Run-time (Dynamic)** → Method overriding  
- **Purpose:** Write flexible and reusable code.

#### 🔹 Method Overriding
- **Definition:** Redefining a base class method in a derived class with the same signature.  
- **Requirement:** `virtual` in base class + `override` in derived class.  
- **Polymorphism:** Enables **run-time polymorphism**.

#### Method Overloading

- **Definition**: Same method name but different parameters (type/number) in the same class.
- **Polymorphism**: Enables compile-time polymorphism.

#### Interview Summary
- Polymorphism: Object can behave differently based on context.
- Overriding: Run-time polymorphism; redefine base class behavior.
- Overloading: Compile-time polymorphism; same method name, different parameters.

## React

### 1. How does React work? [⬆️](#top)

React creates a virtual DOM in memory, which is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. When state changes, React updates the virtual DOM first, then efficiently updates only the changed parts in the real DOM using a diffing algorithm. This makes UI updates fast and efficient.

### 2. What are React Hooks? [⬆️](#top)

React Hooks are special functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Common hooks include useState, useEffect, and useContext. They help manage state, side effects, and context without writing class components.

### 3. What is Context API in ReactJS? [⬆️](#top)

The Context API allows you to share data (like themes or user info) across the component tree without passing props manually at every level. It helps avoid prop drilling and makes global state management easier for certain use cases.

### 4. What are the major features of ReactJS? [⬆️](#top)

Major features include: component-based architecture, virtual DOM, JSX syntax, unidirectional data flow, support for hooks, and strong ecosystem for state management and routing.

### 5. What are the advantages of ReactJS? [⬆️](#top)

React offers fast rendering with the virtual DOM, reusable components, easier debugging, a large community, and flexibility to integrate with other libraries or frameworks.

### 6. What are props in React? [⬆️](#top)

Props (short for properties) are read-only inputs passed from parent to child components. They allow data and event handlers to be shared between components, making them reusable and dynamic.

### 7. What is the use of refs? [⬆️](#top)

Refs provide a way to access and interact with DOM elements or React elements directly, bypassing the normal data flow. They're useful for managing focus, text selection, or triggering animations.

### 8. How would you write an inline style in React? [⬆️](#top)

Inline styles are written as objects using camelCase property names. Example: <div style={{ backgroundColor: 'red', fontSize: 16 }}>Hello</div>

### 9. What is React? [⬆️](#top)

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. It lets you create reusable UI components and efficiently update the UI when data changes.

### 10. What are inline conditional expressions in ReactJS? [⬆️](#top)

Inline conditional expressions let you render content based on conditions, often using the ternary operator or logical &&. Example: {isLoggedIn ? <Logout /> : <Login />}

### 11. What are refs used for in React? [⬆️](#top)

Refs are used to directly access or modify DOM nodes or React elements, such as focusing an input, reading values, or integrating with third-party libraries.

### 12. What is useState() in React? [⬆️](#top)

useState is a React Hook that lets you add state to functional components. It returns a state variable and a function to update it.
Code example:

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
````

### 13. What's the difference between a Controlled component and an Uncontrolled one in React? [⬆️](#top)

Controlled components have their state managed by React via props and state, while uncontrolled components store their own state internally, often accessed via refs.
Detailed explanation: Controlled components are preferred for form handling as they allow validation and state management in React, while uncontrolled components are useful for simple use cases or integrating with non-React code.

### 14. What are advantages of using React Hooks? [⬆️](#top)

Hooks allow you to use state and lifecycle features in functional components, promote code reuse, and make components easier to test and maintain.

### 15. What are Stateful components in React? [⬆️](#top)

Stateful components are components that manage their own state, either using class-based state or hooks like useState in functional components.

### 16. What is Reconciliation in ReactJS? [⬆️](#top)

Reconciliation is the process React uses to update the DOM by comparing the new virtual DOM with the previous one and applying only the necessary changes.
Detailed explanation: React's reconciliation algorithm (diffing) ensures only the parts of the DOM that actually changed are updated, improving performance.

### 17. What is the difference between Component and Container in Redux? [⬆️](#top)

Components are presentational and focus on UI, while containers are connected to Redux and handle data, state, and logic, passing props to components.

### 18. What is JSX? [⬆️](#top)

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks like HTML. It lets you write UI code in a declarative way, which React transforms into JavaScript calls.
Code example:

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

### 19. What are Higher-Order Components (HOC) in React? [⬆️](#top)

HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with enhanced behavior or additional props, enabling code reuse and abstraction.
Code example:

```jsx
function withLogger(WrappedComponent) {
  return function (props) {
    console.log("Props:", props);
    return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
  };
}
```

### 20. What is the difference between Element and Component in ReactJS? [⬆️](#top)

An element is a plain object describing what to render, while a component is a function or class that returns elements and defines behavior.

### 21. What is the difference between state and props? [⬆️](#top)

State is managed within a component and can change over time, while props are passed from parent to child and are read-only.

### 22. What is the difference between a Presentational component and a Container component? [⬆️](#top)

Presentational components focus on how things look and receive data via props, while container components handle how things work, managing state and logic.

### 23. What are Controlled components in ReactJS? [⬆️](#top)

Controlled components are form elements whose values are controlled by React state, making it easy to validate and manage user input.
Code example:

```jsx
<input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />
```

### 24. What are portals in React and when do we need them? [⬆️](#top)

Portals let you render children into a DOM node outside the parent component hierarchy. They're useful for modals, tooltips, or overlays.
Code example:

```jsx
ReactDOM.createPortal(<Modal />, document.getElementById("modal-root"));
```

### 25. What are Fragments in React? [⬆️](#top)

Fragments let you group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. Use <></> or <React.Fragment> to wrap children.
Code example:

```jsx
<>
  <Child1 />
  <Child2 />
</>
```

### 26. How to create refs in React? [⬆️](#top)

Use React.createRef() in class components or the useRef() hook in functional components to create refs.
Code example:

```jsx
const inputRef = useRef();
<input ref={inputRef} />;
```

### 27. What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of setState? [⬆️](#top)

The callback runs after state has been updated and the component has re-rendered, useful for actions that depend on the updated state.

### 28. What are two types of components in ReactJS? [⬆️](#top)

Class components and functional components. Class components use lifecycle methods, while functional components use hooks.

### 29. What are the advantages of using React? [⬆️](#top)

Fast rendering, reusable components, strong community, easy integration, and a rich ecosystem for state management and routing.

### 30. What is state in React? [⬆️](#top)

State is a built-in object that stores data or UI information that can change over time, triggering re-renders when updated.

### 31. What are the limitations of React? [⬆️](#top)

React is only the view layer, requires additional libraries for routing and state management, and can have a learning curve for beginners.

### 32. What is the purpose of using super constructor with props argument in React? [⬆️](#top)

It ensures that the parent class (React.Component) receives the props, making them available as this.props in the constructor.

### 33. What are Stateless components in React? [⬆️](#top)

Stateless components are functional components that do not manage or hold any state; they simply render UI based on props.

### 34. What is the difference between state and props? [⬆️](#top)

State is internal and mutable, while props are external and immutable, passed from parent to child.

### 35. What are the differences between a Class component and Functional component? [⬆️](#top)

Class components use ES6 classes, support lifecycle methods, and manage state with this.state. Functional components are simpler, use hooks for state and effects, and are easier to test.

### 36. What happens when you call setState? [⬆️](#top)

React schedules a re-render, merges the new state with the current state, and updates the UI accordingly.

### 37. When rendering a list what is a key and what is it's purpose? [⬆️](#top)

A key is a unique identifier for each list item, helping React efficiently update and reorder items during re-renders.
Code example:

```jsx
{
  items.map((item) => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>);
}
```

### 38. What happens during the lifecycle of a React component? [⬆️](#top)

Components mount, update, and unmount. Lifecycle methods or hooks let you run code at each stage, such as fetching data or cleaning up resources.
Detailed explanation: Mounting (componentDidMount/useEffect), updating (componentDidUpdate/useEffect), and unmounting (componentWillUnmount/cleanup in useEffect) are the main phases.

### 39. How to call loading function with React useEffect only once? [⬆️](#top)

Pass an empty dependency array to useEffect: useEffect(() => { loadData(); }, []);
Code example:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  loadData();
}, []);
```

### 40. How to access DOM elements in React? [⬆️](#top)

Use refs (useRef or createRef) and attach them to elements. Access the DOM node via ref.current.
Code example:

```jsx
const inputRef = useRef();
<input ref={inputRef} />;
// Access: inputRef.current
```

### 41. How is React different from AngularJS (1.x)? [⬆️](#top)

React is a library focused on the view layer, uses a virtual DOM, and one-way data flow. AngularJS is a full framework with two-way data binding and real DOM updates.

### 42. What does it mean for a component to be mounted in React? [⬆️](#top)

Mounting means the component has been created and inserted into the DOM. It's the initial phase of a component's lifecycle.

### 43. When would you use useRef? [⬆️](#top)

Use useRef to persist values across renders without causing re-renders, or to access DOM elements directly.

### 44. What is the difference between ShadowDOM and VirtualDOM? [⬆️](#top)

Shadow DOM is a browser feature for encapsulating styles and markup. Virtual DOM is a React concept for efficient UI updates.

### 45. Compare useState and useReducer implementations [⬆️](#top)

useState is simpler for basic state, while useReducer is better for complex state logic or when state depends on previous values.

### 46. Do React Hooks cover all use cases for class components? [⬆️](#top)

Most use cases are covered, but some features like error boundaries still require class components.

### 47. How can I make use of Error Boundaries in functional React components? [⬆️](#top)

Error boundaries must be class components, but you can wrap functional components with a class-based error boundary.

### 48. Which lifecycle methods of class component is replaced by useEffect in functional component? [⬆️](#top)

useEffect can replace componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.

### 49. How would you pass data from child to parent component in React? [⬆️](#top)

Pass a callback function from parent to child as a prop, and call it in the child with the data as an argument.

### 50. What would be the common mistake of function being called every time the component renders? [⬆️](#top)

Defining functions or values inside the component body without memoization, causing them to be recreated on every render.

### 51. What are Uncontrolled components?

Uncontrolled components manage their own state internally, typically accessed via refs, rather than being controlled by React state.

### 52. What do these three dots (...) in React do?

The spread operator (...) is used to copy or merge objects/arrays, or to pass props to components.

### 53. What is Key and benefit of using it in lists?

A key uniquely identifies list items, helping React optimize rendering and avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### 54. What are the advantages of Batching in ReactJS?

Batching groups multiple state updates into a single render, improving performance and reducing unnecessary renders.

### 55. How would you prevent a component from rendering in React?

Return null from the component's render method or use conditional rendering to skip rendering.

### 56. Why React uses className over class attribute?

class is a reserved word in JavaScript, so React uses className to avoid conflicts and match the DOM property.

### 57. What does Batching mean in ReactJS?

Batching means combining multiple state updates into a single render cycle for better performance.

### 58. What is prop drilling and how can you avoid it?

Prop drilling is passing data through many layers of components. Avoid it using Context API or state management libraries.

### 59. What is Components Composition in React?

Component composition means building complex UIs by combining simpler components, promoting reusability and flexibility.

### 60. What's the difference between useRef and createRef?

useRef is used in functional components and persists across renders. createRef is used in class components and creates a new ref each time.

### 61. What's wrong with using Context in React?

Overusing Context can lead to unnecessary re-renders and make code harder to maintain. It's best for global data that rarely changes.

### 62. What is StrictMode in React?

StrictMode is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants.

### 63. Why do class methods need to be bound to a class instance?

In JavaScript, class methods lose their context when passed as callbacks. Binding ensures 'this' refers to the class instance.

### 64. What is children prop?

The children prop is a special prop that lets you pass elements or components as content between a component's opening and closing tags.

### 65. What are Stateless components in React?

Stateless components are functional components that do not manage state and simply render UI based on props.

### 66. What is the difference between createElement and cloneElement?

createElement creates a new React element, while cloneElement clones an existing one and can add or override props.

### 67. Are you familiar with Flux in the context of React?

Yes, Flux is an architecture for managing data flow in React apps, emphasizing unidirectional data flow and centralized state management.

### 68. What is the significance of keys in ReactJS?

Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed, optimizing list rendering.

### 69. What's the typical pattern for rendering a list of components from an array in React?

Use the map() function to iterate over the array and return a component for each item, assigning a unique key to each.

### 70. What does shouldComponentUpdate do and why is it important?

shouldComponentUpdate lets you control whether a component re-renders, improving performance by preventing unnecessary updates.

### 71. What's the typical flow of data like in a React + Redux app?

Data flows from the Redux store to components via props, and user actions dispatch actions to update the store.

### 72. What's the difference between an Element and a Component in React?

An element is a plain object describing what to render, while a component is a function or class that returns elements.

### 73. What are some limitations of things you shouldn't do in the component's render method in React?

Avoid side effects, modifying state, or making async calls in render. Only return UI elements.

### 74. Name the different lifecycle methods for a class components

Common methods: constructor, componentDidMount, shouldComponentUpdate, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount, render.

### 75. What is the point of shouldComponentUpdate() method?

It lets you prevent unnecessary re-renders by returning false if the component doesn't need to update.

### 76. What are Pure Components?

Pure components automatically implement a shallow comparison of props and state to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### 77. What is the difference between HTML and React event handling?

React uses camelCase event names and passes events as SyntheticEvent objects, providing cross-browser compatibility.

### 78. How to bind methods or event handlers in JSX callbacks?

Bind them in the constructor, use arrow functions, or use class fields syntax to ensure correct 'this' context.

### 79. What is {this.props.children} and when you should use it?

{this.props.children} renders child elements passed between a component's tags. Use it for wrapper or layout components.

### 80. What is Lifting State Up in ReactJS?

Lifting state up means moving shared state to the closest common ancestor so multiple components can access and update it.

### 81. What are forward refs?

Forward refs let you pass a ref through a component to access a child DOM node or React element directly.

### 82. Why we should not update state directly?

Directly mutating state can lead to unpredictable UI and bugs. Always use setState or the updater function to ensure React tracks changes.

### 83. What are the lifecycle methods of ReactJS class components?

Mounting: constructor, componentDidMount; Updating: shouldComponentUpdate, componentDidUpdate; Unmounting: componentWillUnmount; plus render.

### 84. What are Error Boundaries in ReactJS?

Error boundaries are special class components that catch JavaScript errors in their child component tree and display a fallback UI.

### 85. What are the different phases of ReactJS component lifecycle?

Mounting, updating, and unmounting are the main phases of a React component's lifecycle.

### 86. What is the purpose of super(props)?

It passes props to the parent class (React.Component), making them available as this.props in the constructor.

### 87. When to use useCallback, useMemo and useEffect?

useCallback: memoize functions; useMemo: memoize values; useEffect: run side effects after render.

### 88. Why doesn't this.props.children.map work?

this.props.children may not always be an array. Use React.Children.map to safely iterate over children.

### 89. Can you do Components Inheritance in React?

It's possible but discouraged. React favors composition over inheritance for code reuse and flexibility.

### 90. How to apply validation on props in ReactJS?

Use PropTypes or TypeScript to define and validate prop types for your components.

### 91. What is difference between Incremental DOM and Virtual DOM?

Virtual DOM (React) creates a copy of the DOM and diffs it. Incremental DOM (used by some frameworks) updates the DOM as it traverses the tree.

### 92. When would you use flushSync in ReactJS?

Use flushSync to force React to flush state updates synchronously, useful for immediate UI updates in event handlers.

### 93. Describe Flux vs MVC?

Flux enforces unidirectional data flow and centralized state, while MVC separates concerns into Model, View, and Controller with bidirectional flow.

### 94. Can you force a React component to rerender without calling setState?

You can use forceUpdate() in class components, but it's rarely recommended. In functional components, change state to trigger a re-render.

### 95. When shall we use useReducer hook in ReactJS?

Use useReducer for complex state logic, especially when state depends on previous values or involves multiple sub-values.

### 96. When to use useState vs useReducer?

useState is best for simple state, while useReducer is better for complex or interrelated state logic.

### 97. Explain the Virtual DOM concept in React

The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. React updates it first, then efficiently updates the real DOM based on differences.

### 98. How would you store non-state/instance variables in functional React components?

Use the useRef hook to store mutable values that persist across renders but don't trigger re-renders.

### 99. Explain why and when would you use useMemo()?

useMemo memoizes expensive calculations, preventing unnecessary recalculations on every render. Use it for performance optimization.

### 100. Why does React use SyntheticEvents?

SyntheticEvents provide a consistent, cross-browser wrapper around native events, normalizing behavior and improving compatibility.

### 101. What is the difference between using constructor vs getInitialState in React?

getInitialState is used in older React (createClass). In ES6 classes, use the constructor to initialize state.

### 102. Why would you need to bind event handlers to this?

Binding ensures that 'this' inside the handler refers to the component instance, allowing access to state and props.

### 103. What is the second argument that can optionally be passed to setState and what is its purpose?

The second argument is a callback function that runs after the state update and re-render are complete.

### 104. What's a Pure Functional Component in React?

A pure functional component renders the same output for the same props and has no side effects.

### 105. When is it important to pass props to super(), and why?

Always pass props to super() in the constructor to make them available as this.props in the component.

### 106. How to conditionally add attributes to React components?

Use JavaScript expressions or the spread operator to add attributes based on conditions. Example: <input disabled={isDisabled} />

### 107. Describe how events are handled in React

Events are handled using camelCase props and functions. React wraps events in SyntheticEvent for cross-browser consistency.

### 108. When would you use StrictMode component in React?

Use StrictMode during development to catch potential problems and ensure best practices.

### 109. How would you go about investigating slow React application rendering?

Use React DevTools Profiler, check for unnecessary re-renders, optimize components with memoization, and review state management.

### 110. Does React re-render all components and sub components every time setState is called?

No, only the component whose state changed and its children are re-rendered, unless prevented by shouldComponentUpdate or React.memo.

### 111. How to create Props Proxy for HOC component?

Pass all received props to the wrapped component using the spread operator: <WrappedComponent {...props} />

### 112. What's the difference between useCallback and useMemo in practice?

useCallback memoizes functions, while useMemo memoizes computed values.

### 113. How to avoid the need for binding in React?

Use arrow functions or class fields syntax to automatically bind methods to the class instance.

### 114. What is the key architectural difference between a JavaScript library such as React and a JavaScript framework such as Angular?

React is a library focused on the view layer, giving you more flexibility. Angular is a full framework with built-in solutions for routing, state, and more.

### 115. How does React renderer work exactly when we call setState?

React schedules a re-render, updates the virtual DOM, diffs it with the previous version, and applies minimal changes to the real DOM.

### 116. How to use React.memo()?

Wrap a functional component with React.memo to memoize it, preventing unnecessary re-renders when props haven't changed.

### 117. What is React Fiber?

React Fiber is the new reconciliation engine in React 16+, enabling incremental rendering and better performance.

### 118. Can a custom React hook return JSX?

No, hooks should return values or functions, not JSX. Only components should return JSX.

### 119. Explain some difference between Flux and AngularJS (1.x) approach

Flux uses unidirectional data flow and centralized state, while AngularJS uses two-way data binding and a more tightly coupled architecture.

### 120. What is the order of useInsertionEffect, useEffect and useLayoutEffect hooks at component generation ?

useInsertionEffect runs first, then useLayoutEffect, and finally useEffect after painting.

### 121. What is a Pure Function?

A pure function always returns the same output for the same input and has no side effects.

## React hooks

### 1. What are React Hooks?

Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. They provide a more direct way to work with component logic.
Detailed explanation: Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 to allow you to use state and other React features without writing class components.

### 2. What is useState() in React?

useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to functional components.
Code example:

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: "", age: 0 });
```

### 3. How to call loading function with React useEffect only once?

To run an effect only once, pass an empty dependency array to useEffect.
Code example:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData(); // This runs only on mount
}, []);
```

### 4. How to access DOM elements in React?

Use the useRef hook to access DOM elements directly in functional components.
Code example:

```jsx
const inputRef = useRef();
// Later in JSX
<input ref={inputRef} />;
// Access: inputRef.current.focus();
```

### 5. What are advantages of using React Hooks?

Hooks provide reusability of stateful logic, cleaner code organization, and avoid the complexity of class lifecycle methods.
Detailed explanation: They eliminate the need for HOCs and render props patterns, and make it easier to reuse stateful logic between components.

### 6. What are production use cases for the useRef?

useRef is commonly used for:

- Storing mutable values that don't trigger re-renders
- Accessing DOM elements directly
- Storing previous values
  Code example:

```jsx
const countRef = useRef(0); // Persists between renders
const prevCountRef = useRef(); // Store previous value
```

### 7. What does Batching mean in ReactJS?

Batching is React's way of grouping multiple state updates into a single re-render for better performance.
Detailed explanation: When multiple state updates occur within a single event handler or effect, React batches them together to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### 8. What are common use cases for the useMemo?

useMemo is used for:

- Expensive calculations
- Referential equality in dependencies
- Preventing unnecessary re-renders
  Code example:

```jsx
const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensive(a, b), [a, b]);
```

### 9. Which lifecycle methods of class component is replaced by useEffect in functional component?

useEffect replaces componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.
Detailed explanation: Different combinations of useEffect with dependencies can replicate all lifecycle method behaviors.

### 10. When would you use useContext hook?

Use useContext when you need to consume context values in a functional component, avoiding prop drilling.
Code example:

```jsx
const value = useContext(MyContext);
```

### 11. Is there any problem when using useContext Hook?

Common issues include:

- Over-rendering when context value changes
- Performance concerns with large context values
- Unnecessary re-renders of child components

### 12. Do React Hooks cover all use cases for class components?

Most use cases are covered, but some features like Error Boundaries still require class components.
Detailed explanation: While hooks can handle most scenarios, there are still some edge cases where class components might be necessary.

### 13. How can I make use of Error Boundaries in functional React components?

Error Boundaries must be class components, but you can wrap functional components with them.
Code example:

```jsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  // Error boundary implementation
}
// Usage
<ErrorBoundary>
  <FunctionalComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>;
```

### 14. What are differences between React.memo() and useMemo()?

React.memo memoizes an entire component, while useMemo memoizes a value.
Code example:

```jsx
// React.memo for component memoization
const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(MyComponent);
// useMemo for value memoization
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```

### 15. What are the advantages of Batching in ReactJS?

Batching improves performance by:

- Reducing the number of re-renders
- Grouping state updates together
- Preventing unnecessary DOM updates

### 16. Explain the difference between useState and useRef hooks?

useState triggers re-renders when updated, while useRef persists values between renders without causing re-renders.
Code example:

```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState(0); // Triggers re-render
const ref = useRef(0); // Doesn't trigger re-render
```

### 17. When would you use useRef?

Use useRef for:

- DOM element references
- Storing previous values
- Mutable values that don't need re-renders

### 18. Does React useState Hook update immediately?

No, useState updates are asynchronous and batched for performance.
Code example:

```jsx
setState(newValue); // This won't be available immediately
console.log(state); // Still shows old value
```

### 19. When writing a Custom Hook, what is the difference between it and a normal function?

Custom Hooks can use other hooks and follow hooks rules, while normal functions cannot use hooks.
Code example:

```jsx
// Custom Hook
function useCustomHook() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(0);
  return value;
}
```

### 20. Do two components using the same Hook share state?

No, each call to a Hook gets its own isolated state.
Detailed explanation: Hook calls in different components are completely independent.

### 21. How to use componentWillMount() in React Hooks?

There's no direct equivalent, but you can use useEffect with empty dependencies for similar behavior.
Code example:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // This runs after first render
}, []);
```

### 22. When shall we use useReducer hook in ReactJS?

Use useReducer for complex state logic or when state updates depend on multiple values.
Code example:

```jsx
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```

### 23. Are there any problems using useCallback?

Common issues include:

- Over-optimization
- Creating unnecessary dependencies
- Complexity in maintenance

### 24. How would you store non-state/instance variables in functional React components?

Use useRef for mutable values that don't need to trigger re-renders.
Code example:

```jsx
const instanceValue = useRef(initialValue);
```

### 25. Is there a React hook equivalent to componentDidCatch?

No, error boundaries must still be implemented as class components.

### 26. When to use useState vs useReducer?

Use useState for simple state, useReducer for complex state logic or when state updates are related.
Detailed explanation: useReducer is preferable when you have complex state logic or need to manage multiple related state updates.

### 27. When would you use flushSync in ReactJS?

Use flushSync when you need to force React to flush state updates synchronously.
Code example:

```jsx
flushSync(() => {
  setState(newValue);
}); // State is updated synchronously
```

### 28. When to use useCallback, useMemo and useEffect? [⬆️](#top)

- useCallback: Memoize functions
- useMemo: Memoize values
- useEffect: Handle side effects

### 29. How do I update state on a nested object with useState()? [⬆️](#top)

Always create a new object when updating nested state.
Code example:

```jsx
setState((prev) => ({
  ...prev,
  nested: { ...prev.nested, value: newValue },
}));
```

### 30. Explain why and when would you use useMemo()? [⬆️](#top)

Use useMemo to:

- Optimize expensive calculations
- Maintain referential equality
- Prevent unnecessary re-renders

### 31. What's the difference between useCallback and useMemo in practice? [⬆️](#top)

useCallback memoizes functions, while useMemo memoizes values.
Code example:

```jsx
const memoizedFn = useCallback(() => doSomething(a, b), [a, b]);
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => compute(a, b), [a, b]);
```

### 32. Do Hooks replace render props and higher-order components (HOC)? [⬆️](#top)

Yes, hooks can replace most use cases for render props and HOCs, providing a more direct way to reuse logic.

### 33. How can I force component to re-render with Hooks in React? [⬆️](#top)

Use a state update with a new reference to force a re-render.
Code example:

```jsx
const [, forceUpdate] = useState({});
const handleForceUpdate = () => forceUpdate({});
```

### 34. Can a custom React hook return JSX? [⬆️](#top)

No, hooks should return values or functions, not JSX. Components should render JSX.

### 35. When would you want to avoid useEffect and use useLayoutEffect instead? [⬆️](#top)

Use useLayoutEffect when you need to make DOM measurements or updates that must be synchronous and visible immediately.

- Ensures TypeScript compiler correctly parses JSX elements.

---

### 2. Do we need to compile TypeScript files and why? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Answer
Yes, **TypeScript files must be compiled** because browsers and Node.js only understand **JavaScript**, not TypeScript.

#### 🔑 Why Compilation is Needed
- **Transpilation**: Converts TypeScript (`.ts/.tsx`) → JavaScript (`.js`).  
- **Type Checking**: Catches errors at compile-time (before runtime).  
- **Compatibility**: Ensures modern features (ES6+) are down-leveled for older JS engines if needed.  
- **Productivity**: Provides IntelliSense, autocompletion, and safer refactoring.

---

“TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to JS. I’d use it because it makes large applications safer, more maintainable, and easier to scale than plain JavaScript.”

---


### 5. How to call base class constructor from child class in TypeScript? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Explanation
In TypeScript (and JavaScript ES6 classes), when a **child class extends a parent class**, you must call the parent’s constructor using the `super()` keyword before accessing `this` in the child class.

#### Key Points
- super() must be called before using this in the child constructor.
- You can also call parent methods using super.methodName().
- If the parent has no constructor, TypeScript automatically calls super().

---

### 6. What is TypeScript and why do we need it? [⬆️](#top)

#### Key Points

- Improved Developer Productivity → Autocomplete, IntelliSense, and better refactoring in IDEs.
- Readability & Maintainability → Explicit types make large codebases easier to understand.
- Modern Features → Supports async/await, decorators, optional chaining, generics, etc.
- Scalability → Great for large applications where plain JavaScript becomes harder to manage.
- Community & Ecosystem → Popular frameworks (Angular, React, NestJS) use or support TypeScript.

#### Interview Summary

“TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. We need it because it catches errors at compile time, improves developer experience with better tooling, and makes applications more scalable and maintainable.”

---

### 7. What is TypeScript and why one should use it? [⬆️](#top)

---

### 8. How to perform string interpolation in TypeScript? [⬆️](#top)

#### Interview Summary

“In TypeScript, string interpolation is done using template literals with backticks and ${} syntax. This makes it easier to embed variables and expressions directly into strings.”

#### Key Features
- Use backticks (`) instead of quotes.
- Embed variables/expressions using ${expression}.
- Supports multi-line strings easily.

---

### 9. What are Modules in TypeScript? [⬆️](#top)

- **Modules** are a way to organize and reuse code in TypeScript.  
- Each file is treated as a module if it contains an `import` or `export`.  
- They allow encapsulation, prevent global scope pollution, and improve maintainability.  
- Modules can export classes, functions, variables, or interfaces, and these can be imported in other files.  
- TypeScript supports **ES Modules** and **CommonJS** depending on the configuration.  

---

### Explain Generics in TypeScript [⬆️](#top)

- **Generics** allow creating reusable components that work with different data types.  
- They provide **type safety** while keeping flexibility.  
- Instead of using `any`, generics let you define a placeholder type (like `<T>`) that gets replaced when the function, class, or interface is used.  
- Benefits:  
  - Code reusability  
  - Strong type checking  
  - Better readability and maintainability  

---

### List the built-in types in TypeScript [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Primitive Types
- `number` → Numeric values  
- `string` → Text values  
- `boolean` → `true` or `false`  
- `symbol` → Unique identifiers  
- `bigint` → Large integers beyond `number`  
- `null` → Absence of value  
- `undefined` → Uninitialized variable  

#### 🔹 Object Types
- `object` → Non-primitive objects  
- `Array<T>` or `T[]` → Arrays of type `T`  
- `tuple` → Fixed-size array with specific types `[string, number]`  

#### 🔹 Special Types
- `any` → Disables type checking (use sparingly)  
- `unknown` → Type-safe counterpart of `any`  
- `void` → Functions that return nothing  
- `never` → Functions that never return (e.g., throw error)  
- `enum` → Named constant values  
- `Function` → Function type  

#### ✅ Interview Summary
“TypeScript provides primitive types, object types, and special types like `any`, `void`, and `never` to enforce type safety and flexibility in code.”


---

### 10. What is Optional Chaining in TypeScript? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Definition
- **Optional chaining (`?.`)** allows safely accessing **nested object properties or methods** without causing runtime errors if a reference is `null` or `undefined`.  
- Prevents the need for multiple null checks.

#### 🔹 Key Points
- Stops evaluation if the value before `?.` is `null` or `undefined`.  
- Can be used with **properties, methods, and array elements**.  
- Improves code readability and reduces boilerplate.

#### ✅ Interview Summary
“Optional chaining in TypeScript (`?.`) is used to safely access nested object properties or methods, preventing runtime errors from `null` or `undefined` values.”

---

### 11. How can we use optional chaining in TypeScript? [⬆️](#top)

### 12. How to make Arrays that can only be read in TypeScript? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Readonly Arrays
- Use the `readonly` modifier to create **immutable arrays**.  
- Elements cannot be modified, added, or removed after initialization.  

#### 🔹 Key Points
- Prevents accidental mutations.  
- Ensures data integrity when passing arrays to functions or across modules.  
- Can be combined with **tuples** for fixed-size immutable arrays.

#### ✅ Interview Summary
“In TypeScript, you can make arrays read-only using the `readonly` keyword. This ensures that the array and its elements cannot be modified after creation.”

---

### 13. Describe what are Conditional Types in TypeScript? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Definition
- **Conditional types** allow the type of a variable to be determined based on a **condition**.  
- Syntax: `T extends U ? X : Y` → if `T` extends `U`, type is `X`; otherwise, type is `Y`.  

#### 🔹 Key Points
- Enables **type-level logic** in generics.  
- Useful for creating **flexible, reusable, and type-safe code**.  
- Helps in **transforming types** based on input types.

#### ✅ Interview Summary
“Conditional types in TypeScript let you choose a type based on a condition, making generics more powerful and type-safe.”

---

### 14. What does the pipe, | mean in TypeScript? [⬆️](#top)

#### ✅ Interview Summary
“In TypeScript, the pipe `|` is used to define union types, allowing a variable to hold values of multiple specified types while preserving type checking.”

---

### 15. How do we create an enum with string values? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Definition
- **Enums** in TypeScript allow defining a set of **named constants**.  
- By default, enums use numeric values, but we can assign **custom string values**.

---

### 16. What is the difference between `String` and `string` in TypeScript? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 `string` (lowercase)
- **Primitive type** in TypeScript.  
- Represents textual data.  
- Preferred for type annotations.

#### 🔹 `String` (uppercase)
- **Object wrapper** for primitive `string`.  
- Provides additional methods (inherited from `String` object).  
- Less efficient; generally avoid using as a type.

#### 🔹 Key Points
- Use `string` for variables, function parameters, and return types.  
- `String` is rarely used except when explicitly working with **String objects**.  

#### ✅ Interview Summary
“`string` is the primitive type for textual data in TypeScript, while `String` is the object wrapper. Always prefer `string` for type annotations.”

---

### 17. What is a TypeScript Map file? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Definition
- A **TypeScript Map file (`.map`)** is a **source map** that maps the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript source.  
- Helps **debuggers and browsers** display the original `.ts` code instead of the transpiled `.js`.

#### 🔹 Key Points
- Generated when **`sourceMap: true`** is set in `tsconfig.json`.  
- Essential for **debugging TypeScript** in browsers or Node.js.  
- Allows setting breakpoints and inspecting TypeScript code during runtime.  

#### ✅ Interview Summary
“A TypeScript Map file is a source map that links the generated JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code, enabling better debugging and development experience.”

---

### 18. What is the purpose of Nullish Coalescing operator? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Definition
- The **Nullish Coalescing operator (`??`)** provides a **default value** when a variable is `null` or `undefined`.  
- Unlike `||`, it does **not treat falsy values like 0, false, or empty string as null**.

#### 🔹 Key Points
- Simplifies conditional checks for `null` or `undefined`.  
- Useful for setting default values without overwriting valid falsy values.  
- Often used with optional properties or function parameters.

#### ✅ Interview Summary
“The nullish coalescing operator (`??`) in TypeScript returns the right-hand value only if the left-hand value is `null` or `undefined`, providing a safe way to assign defaults without affecting other falsy values.”


---

### 19. What are assertion functions? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Definition
- **Assertion functions** in TypeScript are functions that **assert a condition is true** at runtime.  
- They **tell the compiler** that a certain type or condition can be assumed after the function runs.

---

### 20. Which access modifiers are implied when not specified? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Explanation
- In TypeScript, if no access modifier is specified for **class members (properties or methods)**, the **default is `public`**.  
- This means the member is accessible **from anywhere**.

---

### 21. What is Type Erasure in TypeScript? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Definition
- **Type Erasure** refers to the process where **TypeScript removes all type annotations** during compilation.  
- The resulting JavaScript **contains no types**, only the runtime code.

---

### 22. What is the difference between Classes and Interfaces in TypeScript? [⬆️](#top)

| Feature                | Class                                           | Interface                                      |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**            | Blueprint for creating objects with implementation | Blueprint for defining **contracts** without implementation |
| **Implementation**     | Can contain **implementation code** (methods, constructors, properties) | Cannot have implementation (except in TypeScript 4.3+ with default methods) |
| **Instantiation**      | Can be instantiated using `new`               | Cannot be instantiated directly               |
| **Inheritance**        | Supports **extends** for single or multiple inheritance (via implements) | Supports **extends** and **multiple inheritance** of interfaces |
| **Type Checking**      | Acts as a type and can implement interfaces  | Only a type definition, used for type checking |
| **Access Modifiers**   | Can use `public`, `private`, `protected`     | Cannot use access modifiers (all members are public) |

#### ✅ Interview Summary
“Classes provide structure and behavior with implementation, while interfaces define contracts for type checking without implementing functionality. Use interfaces for type safety and classes for object creation.”


---

### 23. What is Decorators in TypeScript? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Definition
- **Decorators** are **special functions** that can be attached to classes, methods, properties, or parameters to **modify or enhance behavior**.  
- They are a form of **meta-programming** and are widely used in frameworks like Angular.

#### 🔹 Key Points
- Requires enabling **`experimentalDecorators`** in `tsconfig.json`.  
- Can be used to add **logging, validation, dependency injection**, or other cross-cutting concerns.  
- Types of decorators:  
  - **Class Decorator** – modifies or annotates a class  
  - **Method Decorator** – modifies a method  
  - **Property Decorator** – modifies a property  
  - **Parameter Decorator** – modifies a method parameter  

#### ✅ Interview Summary
“Decorators in TypeScript are functions that can be applied to classes, methods, properties, or parameters to add behavior or metadata, commonly used for logging, validation, or dependency injection.”

---

### 24. How could you check null and undefined in TypeScript? [⬆️](#top)

#### Key Points
- == null covers both null and undefined.
- Use === for strict type checks.
- Nullish coalescing (??) provides a default value safely.

#### Interview Summary

- “In TypeScript, you can check for null and undefined using strict equality, loose equality (== null), or safely access nested properties with optional chaining and nullish coalescing.”

---

### 25. Could we use TypeScript on backend and how? [⬆️](#top)

“Yes, TypeScript can be used on the backend with Node.js. It allows writing type-safe, maintainable server-side code, and can be compiled or executed directly using tools like tsc or ts-node.”

---

|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Typing**                   | Static typing (optional, enforced at compile-time) | Dynamic typing (runtime only)   |
| **Compilation**              | Needs to be compiled to JavaScript      | Runs directly in browsers/Node  |
| **Error Checking**            | Catches errors at compile-time          | Errors appear at runtime        |
| **OOP Support**               | Supports classes, interfaces, generics, access modifiers | Supports classes, basic OOP features |
| **Tooling**                   | Better IDE support with IntelliSense, autocomplete, and refactoring | Limited compared to TypeScript |
| **Community Usage**           | Popular in large-scale apps and frameworks like Angular, NestJS | Universal, all browsers support |
| **Features**                  | Supports modern ES features plus types, enums, decorators | Only JavaScript features (ES5/ES6+) |

#### ✅ Interview Summary
“TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to JavaScript, offering static typing, better tooling, and maintainable code. JavaScript is dynamically typed and runs directly without compilation.”

---

### 27. What is Interface in TypeScript? [⬆️](#top)

#### 🔹 Use Interfaces When:
- You want to **define a contract or shape** of an object without implementation.  
- You need **type checking** and flexibility in large codebases.  
- You want to allow **multiple inheritance** by extending multiple interfaces.  

#### 🔹 Use Classes When:
- You want to **create objects with behavior** (methods) and state (properties).  
- You need **constructors, inheritance, and encapsulation**.  
- You plan to **instantiate objects** or implement an interface.

#### ✅ Interview Summary
“Use interfaces to define object contracts and ensure type safety. Use classes when you need actual implementations, object instantiation, and OOP features like inheritance and encapsulation.”
